to re-work it.

Source for my [Brizzled][] blog.  Must be formatted with [Octopress][].

Conventions, beyond those dictated by Octopress:

* Images that accompany a blog article are in `source/images/slug`, where
  *slug* is the blog article slug. For instance, the images for
  `source/_posts/2011-08-26-mac-os-x-lion-has-ruined-my-macbook-pro.markdown`
  are in `source/images/2011-08-26-mac-os-x-lion-has-ruined-my-macbook-pro`.
* Similarly, any attachments for an article are in `source/attachments/slug`.
