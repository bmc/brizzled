Mr. McQueary,

Nine years ago, you claim you witnessed a horrific act of molestation being
performed on a young boy, late one evening in an athletic shower room at
Penn State. I cannot, for the life of me, get my mind around your reaction
to that event. According to the [grand jury report][], you chose to leave
the room, "distraught."

You are a larger than average man. At the time, you were accustomed to
the physical violence of college football. Yet, you simply turned tail and
fled.

You could have shouted at Jerry Sandusky to stop what he was doing. You could
have intervened, physically; there's no question that at 28, and in your
physical condition at the time, you could've overpowered a naked, middle-age
man. Either action would have prevented that man from continuing his
assault on the young boy--an assault that surely caused profound and
lasting damage that boy's pysche.

You could have called the police and provided eyewitness testimony against
the man, thus helping to prevent the subsequent years of sexual abuse he
allegedly perpetrated against more young children.

You did neither of these things. Instead, according to the grand jury
report, you fled from the locker room and called your dad, who counseled
you to tell Joe Paterno--which, apparently, you did, but not until the next
day. You can be excused for, perhaps, having had a naive belief that the
almighty Coach Paterno would fix everything. Clearly, you could not have known
that Paterno would simply kick the matter upstairs.

But that doesn't excuse *your* inaction.

What of that young boy in the shower, the boy whose violation you could
have, and *should* have, stopped? What of all the other young boys who were
later violated by the same man? It was within your power to stop the rape
and to help prevent the future abuse.

But, you didn't. You called your dad, and you told your coach. And that
was that.

You certainly did not molest those boys, but, by your inaction, you were,
and you remain, complicit in the awful deeds perpetrated against them.

I've no doubt that the image of that shower-room rape remains with you to
this day, haunting you. Imagine how the actual act must haunt that boy in
the shower.

I'm betting you aren't very comfortable with all the media attention you're
getting right now. Alas, the attention, and the recriminations, are deserved.
