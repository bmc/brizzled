Recently, I've gotten involved with my college
[alma mater](http://www.temple.edu/), as a mentor and a member of the alumni board of my
[college within the university](http://www.temple.edu/cst/default.html).
One thing struck me, not too long ago, as I walked across campus. My alma mater
has changed quite a bit since I left there, after obtaining my bachelor's
degree, 30 years ago. Yet, when I step foot on campus, part of me still feels
like I'm going home again.

This feeling is rather odd, when I stop to think about it. I spent a mere four
years of my life thereâ€”a drop in the bucket, considering that I've spent 12
times that many years _not_ being there, both before and after. Yet, walking on
campus, three solid decades after I left, still evokes strong feelings and
strong memories.

Perhaps it's because I still count several people from those days among my very
closest and dearest friends. However, while I think that's a big part of the
feeling, there's more to it than that. I believe those coming-home feelings are
a testament to the impact the college experience can have on the lives of
people who are just beginning to reach for adulthood.

To all those high school seniors who are ready to fling their mortarboards high
in the air and spend a carefree summer, before moving on to college: Make the
most of your college days. Soak up new friends, new experiences, and new
knowledge. Enjoy the new feelings of freedom, and embrace the new
responsibility you have for ensuring your _own_ success and happiness. Enjoy
what you can, even while working your butts off, because the experiences coming
up are likely to have a lasting impact on your entire life.
