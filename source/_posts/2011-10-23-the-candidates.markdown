A temporary departure from technical topics, for an amusing cartoon.
Well, amusing to _me_, anyway...

**Update:** I posted a follow-up cartoon [here](/id/121/).

<div markdown="1" style="float: center; width: 673px !important" class="image-container">
<img src="candidates-2012.png" width="673" height="525"><br clear="all"/>
</div>

The comic book typeface is called *Unmasked*, and it's available, free for
non-commercial use, from [Blambot](http://www.blambot.com/).
