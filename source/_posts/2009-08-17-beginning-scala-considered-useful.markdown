I picked up a copy of [Beginning Scala][] a week ago, and I'm finding it to
be a useful complement to [Programming in Scala][]. I dropped a quick note
to David Pollak, the author of *Beginning Scala*, and in his response, he
wrote:

> Oddly enough... I think *Beginning Scala* is kinda useless for
> folks who are already into *Programming in Scala*... but I'm glad
> you're finding it useful!

He's wrong, though, at least for me.

I find, when I'm learning a new language, that different approaches fire
different synapses. *Programming in Scala* (sometimes called "the staircase
book", for its front cover) is an in-depth book that covers [Scala][] in
great detail. It is, in every way, the [K & R][]) of Scala. I have a
copy of *Programming in Scala*; I've read it, and I continue to refer to it
and re-read parts of it.

Now that I'm about halfway through *Beginning Scala*, I'm finding
that it's pointing out some new tricks, tricks I missed in the
staircase book and on the mailing lists. I'm certain I could find
these tricks find by poring back over the staircase book, but
Pollak's clear, concise and highly practical approach makes them
readily apparent and easy to grasp.

When I was doing a lot of C programming, I had several C language books on
my bookshelf, all within easy reach. The two I used most often were the
venerable [K & R][]) (I had two editions of that one) and
[Harbison and Steele][]. Both books were useful, for different reasons. One
did not replace the other; they complemented each other nicely. Similarly,
I find that *Programming in Scala* and *Beginning Scala* are useful
complements to each other.

I've been using Scala for several months now, and it's not the
first programming language I've taught myself (not by a long shot).
It is a complex and powerful language, and I cannot learn all its
tricks from one book, or even from reading alone. I'll be learning
it and refining my use of it for awhile yet, which makes me, at
best, an intermediate Scala user, despite many years of experience
as a programmer. Alternate viewpoints help, and although
*Beginning Scala* is ostensibly targeted at Scala beginners, it
assumes the reader is not a programming beginner or an idiot. It's
written in a concise, practical style that contrasts nicely with
the style of *Programming in Scala*. The different approaches the
two books take hammer home many of the concepts of Scala in a way
that either book, by itself, does not.

Neither book has made it to my bookshelf yet, because I keep
referring to both of them. For me, that's proof enough of their
value.
