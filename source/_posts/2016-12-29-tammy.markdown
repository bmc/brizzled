[Debbie Reynolds][] starred in
[_Tammy and the Bachelor_][] in 1957. The song she
sang in the film, "[Tammy][]", reached #1 on the music charts.

For years, I'd heard a story that the popularity of the song caused a spike in
the number of children named "Tammy". I was curious whether that was true.

I happen to have 
[first name popularity data from the Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/limits.html)
lying around. My copy of the data covers the years 1880 through 2014.

I ran a quick analysis on "Tammy". Some years are missing in the data, at least
for "Tammy". But, the following graph confirms a spike in the name "Tammy",
coincident with the movie and the song. Of course, that's not proof that the
movie and song *caused* the spike, but it seems likely.
