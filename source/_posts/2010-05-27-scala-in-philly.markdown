A few of us [Scala][] enthusiasts in and around the Philadelphia, PA, area
have been throwing around the idea of a Philly-area Scala group. Courtesy
of [Mark Chadwick][], we already have a cool name; we just need the people
to go with it.

The proposed group name is PHASE, for *Philly Area Scala Enthusiasts*. This
name is a blatant riff on *BASE*, the [Bay Area Scala Enthusiasts][] group.
PHASE currently has a [mailing list][]. We're trying to gauge how much
interest there is in Scala, in the Philadelphia area. If you're interested,
please come join the mailing list.

If we can get 20 people (give or take), we have a big enough group to
warrant monthly meet-ups. The idea, obviously, is to provide a means for
Philly-area Scala users and fans to get together and network, share
experiences, help each other out, invite speakers, evangelize
Scala--whatever.

If you think this sounds as interesting and useful as we do, then stop by
the [mailing list][] and sign up, so we know how to reach you.
