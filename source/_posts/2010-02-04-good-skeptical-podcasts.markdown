Over the past few years, I've become more and more of a [skeptic][] and
rationalist. (Long live the [Age of Enlightenment][].) Along the way, I've
become enamored of various skeptically-oriented podcasts.

[Mark Crislip][] (an M.D. and infectious disease specialist) has several
entertaining podcasts:

- [Puscast][], a biweekly, CME-accredited review of the infectious disease
  literature. I actually find this one to be good listening, despite not
  being a health care worker.

- [A Gobbet o' Pus][]. Podcasts based on Crislip's
  [Rubor Dolor Calor Tumor][] blog. These are usually short, about five
  minutes or so, and touch on medical-related issues.

- [Quackcast][], a "podcast review of Quacks, Frauds and Charlatans. Oops.
  That's not right. That should be Supplements, Complementary and
  Alternative Medicine i.e. SCAM." Highly rational and frequently
  hilarious.

In addition, there are a couple others I like:

- [Skeptic's Guide to the Universe][]. A panel of skeptics, most of whom
  are involved in the New England Skeptical Society. Plenty of good info on
  this podcast, as well as a weekly dose of rational thinking. Worth
  listening to. Episodes range from 20 minutes to 45 minutes in length.

- Brian Dunning's [Skeptoid][], a short, typically single-topic, skeptical
  podcast. Most episodes are under 15 minutes.

I'm always on the lookout for other podcasts people think are
interesting. Feel free to share.
