Late in 2010, I decided to register a formal [service mark][] for my
company, ArdenTex, Inc. Registering a trademark or service mark is simple
enough these days: You go to the [appropriate web page][] of the
[United States Patent and Trademark Office][], fill out some occasionally
puzzling forms, send them in, pay the fee ($275.00 for filing
electronically, as of this writing), and wait. Then wait some more.

If you're willing to spend some time, you don't need to hire a lawyer; you
can do the job yourself. (I did.)

A few months later, the USPTO will get around to reviewing your application
and, if it's kosher, they'll publish it in a huge document of proposed
marks, allowing a 30-day challenge period. (Having searched through such a
document for *my* mark, I picture paralegals or associates in various law
offices being tasked with the dull job of reading every page, looking for
possible conflicts with existing trademarks or service marks.)

If there are no challenges to your mark during the review period, the USPTO
will grant the registration in another 45 days. At that point, you are free
to put that little &reg; after your mark's symbol or phrase.

That's it.

Predictably there are all manner of shady firms out there attempting to
turn this process into easy money.

I received notification from the USPTO last week that my registered service
mark had been granted. Two days ago, I received two separate, slightly
different, letters from some company in Bratislava, Slovak Republic. One
(pictured) has "Patent Trademark Register" at the top, next to a portion of
a United States flag. The other has the same flag logo, with "Register of
International Patents and Trademarks" in a gothic font, at the top. Both
appear to be from the same Slovakian company.

Both letters are deliberately styled to look invoices from official
trademark-granting organizations. Each one bills my company for more than
$2,600.00 US. At the bottom of both letters, in small print, is a paragraph
with similar (but not identical) wording:

> Dear madam, and sir,
>
> the publishing of the public registration of your patent is the basis of
> our offer. We offer the registration of your Patent dates in our private
> Database.  ...  Our offer will be accepted, wit the payment of the amount,
> and becomes a binding contract between you and ODM srl, is irrevocable
> an \[*sic*\] legally binding for one year. Please notice \[*sic*\] that this
> private registration hasn't any connection with the publication of official
> registrations, and is not a registration by a government organization, and
> we haven't any business relation yet. This offer for registration is not an
> invoice but a solicitation without obligation to pay, unless our offer is
> accepted.

Clearly, they're hoping that some companies will just pay the "bill",
assuming that it's official or necessary to secure their
international trademark rights. Perhaps some companies even fall for *both*
phony bills. (Bonus!)

In the US, the only entity that you must legally pay, to register your
trademark or service mark, is the
[United States Patent and Trademark Office][]. You can safely ignore any
purported "bill" from any other group.

Here are some other stories and web sites related to this kind of scam:

These scams are common. "Read the fine print" and "Keep your bullshit
detector plugged in" remain, as always, good advice.
