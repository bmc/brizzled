If you have a young daughter, you've probably run across the
[Polly Pocket][] phenomenon by now. But,
in case you haven't, Polly Pockets are small dolls, a couple of
inches tall, that come with rubbery plastic clothes, shoes, hats,
and other sundries. Little girls seem love them; they're very
popular. My four-year-old daughter first saw them when she was
three, at someone else's house; she was instantly hooked. She's
rarely, if ever, exposed to commercial television, so she didn't
get taken in by overt marketing; something about the small dolls
and their tiny clothes just instantly appealed to her. We now have
our own growing collection of Polly Pockets; she'll sometimes spend
an hour or more playing with them, changing their outfits, putting
them here, putting them there--she loves them. My niece, who's
several years older than my daughter, happened to be visiting one
day; upon seeing the Polly Pockets, she too, was hooked
immediately. Talk about your inadvertent, but nearly perfect,
[viral marketing.][]

As plastic toys go, they're kind of cute. And they promote play
that doesn't involve television. We're all for that. Naturally, the
marketing hordes at [Disney][] couldn't
possibly fail to latch onto something this popular, especially if
the concept could be shoehorned into their annoying and ubiquitous
Disney Princess line of merchandise.

So, I wasn't really surprised to see Disney Princess-branded Polly
Pocket knock-offs suddenly appear in various stores. The Disney
Princess dolls are similar to the "real thing," but the Disney
designers had a few extra kinks to work out. The designers of the
modern-styled Polly Pockets aren't constrained in the clothes their
dolls can wear. Disney's designers aren't so lucky; some of the
Disney Princess characters have these narrow-waisted medieval
gowns. The dolls' heads won't fit through the narrow waists, and
it's nearly impossible to shove the doll into the dress feet-first.
Disney's Macabre Solution? Take the doll's head off--which *does*
make it easier to dress the doll--then replace the head when the
doll is dressed.

Explain *that* one to your three-year-old.

As if that weren't Brothers Grimm enough, the Aladdin doll takes
the Macabre Solution a step further. The Aladdin doll comes with
two fezzes. Apparently, the designers had difficulty figuring out
how to keep Aladdin's small fezzes on his head, so they opted for a
brute force solution. Each fez has a peg molded to it; viewed from
the side, it looks a little like a thumb tack. And, as you can see
from the photos, Aladdin's head has a big hole in the crown.
Aladdin's fezzes are really just spikes driven straight into his
[parietal lobes][].

Disney is one creepy behemoth.
