As noted in a [prior post](/blog/2016/12/29/tammy/),
I happen to have 
[first name popularity data from the Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/limits.html)
lying around. (In my job at [Databricks](https://databricks.com/), we
sometimes use that data in demos and training curriculum.)

While chatting idly with a co-worker, about the names people choose for their
children, it occurred to me to search for a particular _set_ of first names,
specifically, names from J.R.R. Tolkien's _Lord of the Rings_.

Was anyone _so_ enamored with the books, and the Peter Jackson movies, that
they chose to name their kids after Middle Earth characters?

I think you already know the answer to that.

<!-- more -->

The data includes first names and the number of people with that first name,
divided by year, as recorded by the United States Social Security
Administration. It covers the years 1880 through 2014.

So, without further ado, let's start with:

## The Fellowship

There are no **Frodos**, **Boromirs**, **Gimlis**, or **Meriadocs** at all.
There _are_ some **Pippins**, but they're all girls; it's probably fair to
assume they're _not_ named after Master Peregrine Took.

But, there _are_ some **Aragorns**. _(Seriously?)_

And, a few parents saw fit to name their sons **Samwise**.

Perhaps more surprising is that there were 7 boys born in 2003 whose parents
chose to name them **Legolas**. They'd be 14 now. I hope they're surviving
adolescence okay.

And, of course, there's **Gandalf**. No one would name his son Gandalf,
right? 

_(Cough!)_ **Wrong**. The parents of 5 boys born in 1970 chose Gandalf as the
perfect name for their little boys.

## Bilbo

Old Bilbo kicked the whole thing off, really. So, what about him?

Oddly, there are quite a few people named Bilbo. All were born before _LOTR_
was published.

## Other elves

**Galadriel** charmed the parents of baby girls throughout the years:

**Arwen** has had a nice long run as a girl's name, as well.

{% imgpopup /images/2017-11-03-more-kid-names/arwen.png 50% Arwen %}

Unsurprisingly, no one opted for **Celeborn**. (Or, if they did, the kid never
got a Social Security card.)

## Rohan and Gondor

I found no people named **Eomer**. But **Eowyn** rivals Galadriel and Arwen:

{% imgpopup /images/2017-11-03-more-kid-names/eowyn.png 75% Eowyn %}

And there are a few young boys in the United States named **Théoden**:

{% imgpopup /images/2017-11-03-more-kid-names/theoden.png 75% Théoden %}

(Is "Ted" a legitimate nickname for Théoden?)

**Faramir** seems like a nice honorable name, doesn't it? No one chose that
one, either. **Denethor** is also missing, which is probably a good thing.

## Anyone else?

Before you ask, no, no one who got a Social Security card was cursed with the
name **Sauron** or **Saruman**, at least not up to 2014. And there are no
**Radagasts**, **Gollums** or **Smeagols**, either.


For the hell of it, I threw in the Dwarves from _The Hobbit_, **Fili**,
**Kili**, **Oin**, **Gloin**, **Bifur**, **Bofur**, **Bombur**, **Dori**,
**Nori**, **Dwalin**, **Balin**, **Dain**, **Nain**, **Thorin**. Of course,
it's entirely possible that parents chose names like Bain and Dain for other
reasons.

{% imgpopup /images/2017-11-03-more-kid-names/hobbit-1.png 50% Dwarves %}

I got hits for Dain, Nain, Nori, Fili, Balin and Thorin.

Finally, I dropped out the names that are legitimate first names in cultures
outside the United States:

* Dain (Latvia and Lithuania)
* Balin (India, from Hindi)
* Nori (Japan)

That left Nain, Fili and Thorin.

{% imgpopup /images/2017-11-03-more-kid-names/hobbit-2.png 50% Dwarves %}

There were 5 boys named **Thorin** born in 1968; they'd be just shy of 50 now.
Meanwhile, 112 Thorins were born in 2014. (I guarantee at least one joker
gave an oaken shield as a first birthday present.)

## Conclusion

I really cannot think of a conclusion to this silly exercise, other than to
make a humble request: If you're one of the 47-year-old Gandalfs born in 1970,
send a photo, man.
