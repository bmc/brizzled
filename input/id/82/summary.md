title: Wrapping an executable inside a Mac OS X application
date: 2008-10-22

I installed [Wireshark][] on my MacBook Pro via [MacPorts][], because the
prebuilt Wireshark package didn't work on my machine, due to some dynamic
library version conflict. However, I still wanted a Wireshark icon I could
drop into my dock, to permit single-click launching of Wireshark. Long-time
Mac enthusiasts no doubt could wrap a "naked" executable in their sleep,
but doing so was a new exercise to me. This article describes what I did.
