title: Why is Python more fun than Java?
date: 2008-07-28

For [nearly nine years][], I worked almost exclusively in [Java][]. For me,
Java was a productivity enhancer, over C and C++, and I greatly enjoyed
working in it. Lately, however, I've been programming in [Python][] almost
exclusively, and I'm having so much fun with it that I have little desire
to go back to programming in Java. I've been mulling over why I find
programming in Python to be so much more fun . In this article, I am going
to capture and explore some of those thoughts.
