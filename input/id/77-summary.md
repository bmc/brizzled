title: Writing Blogging Software for Google App Engine
date: 2008-08-07

As noted previously, I recently rehosted this blog on Google's
[App Engine][] (GAE). Writing a small, but functional, blog engine is a
useful exercise in learning a web framework. I wrote blog software to learn
more about Django, and I ported it to App Engine to learn more about App
Engine.

In this article, I recreate the steps necessary to build a blogging
engine that runs under GAE.
