title: Scala and Python: An informal TCP performance benchmark
date: 2009-03-09

I've been using [Python][] in a large-scale, high-throughput,
high-availability network application. The JVM seems easier to scale than
CPython, at least for what we're doing. [Scala][] runs on the JVM, and it's
more fun to program than Java. How does its performance measure up to
Python?
