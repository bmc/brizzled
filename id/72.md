And my blog, such as it is, returns to life.
}}

A few months ago, I moved my web server to an off-site
[VPS][] server.
At the time, I shut down my
[WordPress][]-based blog and swore that I
would not fire it up again until it was running on a platform that
was better than [PHP][]. (I *really* dislike
PHP.)

Well, I've resurrected my blog (with a different name), and it's
now running under [Django][], using
some custom [Python][] code I've developed
myself.

'Cause, you see, [Python rocks][].
