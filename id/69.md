Is my MacBook Pro's screen going completely wacky? Or is something
else going on?





}}

This is the story of an unintended interference between two
UI-aware applications. This kind of unexpected interaction happens
a lot with software.

The computer I use at home is a 17"
[MacBook Pro][]. The machine's less
than a year old, and yesterday, the display started
[acting funny][].
The display began to look more and more harsh and washed out. By
the end of the day, a typical window looked like this:

![bad Finder display][]
instead of how it should look:

![good Finder display][]
I was having increasing difficulty reading my email, looking at the
calendar entries in iCal, or doing much of anything. The
[photos][] I use as my background were
also looking very unappealing.

"Great," I thought. "A problem with the LCD."

Luckily, the machine is less than a year old, so it's still under
hardware warranty. But I wasn't looking forward to the hassle of
getting it repaired.

Then, I logged out. When the login screen appeared, the display
looked normal again. I logged back in. Initially, the display
looked fine, but then it "went bad" again partway through the login
process.

I created a new account, then logged out of my account and into the
new one. The display looked perfectly normal. I logged out and
logged back into my account again. Once again, partway during the
login, the display went south.

Okay, it clearly was not a hardware failure; there was something
peculiar to my account that was causing the problem. I logged out
again. From a remote [SSH][] window on
another machine, I moved all the files out of my home directory.
Then, I logged into the laptop again. Everything looked perfectly
fine. So, I began the tedious process of logging out, restoring a
directory, logging back in, logging out, restoring a directory,
logging back in ...

It didn't take long. As soon as I restored my
`Applications/Preferences` directory, the problem came back.

After digging through the files in that directory (starting with
the most recently modified ones), I finally found a likely
culprit:

    $ cd ~/Library/Preferences
    $ plutil -convert xml1 -o /tmp/foo.xml com.apple.universalaccess.plist
    $ cat /tmp/foo.xml

The constants of that [file:][]

    &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
    &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" 
              "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
    &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
    &lt;dict&gt;
            &lt;key&gt;PID&lt;/key&gt;
            &lt;integer&gt;6282&lt;/integer&gt;
            &lt;key&gt;UserAssignableHotKeys&lt;/key&gt;
            &lt;array&gt;
                    &lt;dict&gt;
                            &lt;key&gt;enabled&lt;/key&gt;
                            &lt;true/&gt;
                            &lt;key&gt;key&lt;/key&gt;
                            &lt;integer&gt;99&lt;/integer&gt;
                            &lt;key&gt;modifier&lt;/key&gt;
                            &lt;integer&gt;0&lt;/integer&gt;
                            &lt;key&gt;sybmolichotkey&lt;/key&gt;
                            &lt;integer&gt;64&lt;/integer&gt;
                    &lt;/dict&gt;
                    &lt;dict&gt;
                            &lt;key&gt;enabled&lt;/key&gt;
                            &lt;true/&gt;
                            &lt;key&gt;key&lt;/key&gt;
                            &lt;integer&gt;49&lt;/integer&gt;
                            &lt;key&gt;modifier&lt;/key&gt;
                            &lt;integer&gt;1572864&lt;/integer&gt;
                            &lt;key&gt;sybmolichotkey&lt;/key&gt;
                            &lt;integer&gt;65&lt;/integer&gt;
                    &lt;/dict&gt;
            &lt;/array&gt;
            &lt;key&gt;closeViewDriverMouseZoomSwitch&lt;/key&gt;
            &lt;true/&gt;
            &lt;key&gt;closeViewScrollWheelToggle&lt;/key&gt;
            &lt;true/&gt;
            &lt;key&gt;contrast&lt;/key&gt;
            &lt;real&gt;0.30812768&lt;/real&gt;
    &lt;/dict&gt;
    &lt;/plist&gt;

The culprit:

    &lt;key&gt;contrast&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;real&gt;0.30812768&lt;/real&gt;

I removed the `contrast` keyword and value and recreated the binary
[file:][]

    $ plutil -convert binary1 -o com.apple.universalaccess.plist /tmp/foo.xml

After logging out and logging back in, everything was perfect
again.

But how did the Universal Access contrast value suddenly get set? I
decided to look at the Universal Access preferences screen, in the
System Preferences application:

![Universal Access][]
Looking at that screen, I knew immediately what had happened. As
the Universal Access Preference screen clearly shows, the default
keyboard shortcut for boosting the screen contrast is
Command-Option-Control-*period*. I'd been typing that key sequence.
Why? Well, I recently installed
[Quicksilver][], the
[Leatherman&amp;\#x2122;][] of Mac OS X
applications. Using Quicksilver's iTunes plug-in, I'd created
keyboard shortcuts so I could increase and decrease the iTunes
volume settings, skip to the next or previous song, and pause and
resume iTunes without having to switch to the iTunes window. I
often pause whatever I'm playing on iTunes when I pick up the
phone, and that day had been a fairly busy phone day; it's
extraordinarily convenient and efficient to pause and resume iTunes
from the keyboard. The keyboard shortcut I'd chosen for the
pause/resume action was Command-Option-Control-*period*, chosen
*deliberately* so that it wouldn't interfere with Emacs keys, the
hot keys in my [Java IDE][], and other
applications. Little did I know that I'd chosen the exact same key
sequence used by the Mac OS X Universal Access system to
**increase the screen contrast.** Every time I paused or resumed
iTunes, I boosted the screen contrast a little bit, until finally,
the screen looked like crap.

A little experimentation showed that unchecking the "Enable access
for assistive devices" checkbox had no effect on this feature; even
with that checkbox unchecked, the Command-Option-Control-*period*
shortcut still increased the screen contrast. I didn't want to
change my iTunes shortcut, because it's a key sequence I'm not
likely to hit by accident. (I'm sure that's why it was also chosen
for Universal Access's "Increase contrast" function.) To fix the
problem, I had to disable the corresponding Universal Access
keyboard shortcut entirely, via System Preferences &gt; Keyboard
and Mouse &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts. For good measure, I disabled
*all* the Universal Access keyboard shortcuts:
