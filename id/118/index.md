While I can't say I'm overly fond of the hyper-controlled [walled garden][]
Apple is building, I will never have anything but admiration and respect
for [Steve Jobs][]. His singular drive, his strong sense of design, and his
anal-retentive need to make Apple's machines both beautiful and easy to use
transformed computers from confusing tools that made the average person
swear, into tiny, wondrous and sleek have-to-haves that are as familiar and
comfortable as the morning newspaper they helped to bury.

I own an aging [MacBook Pro][], which I will be replacing soon, with a
brand new MacBook Pro. I own an [iPad][], and I can honestly say I am in
love with that device. In our family, [iPods][] abound. I am not an
exclusive Apple geek; I have an [Android][] phone, and I spend as much
time on Linux as I do on my Mac. But Apple's technology stands apart, and
Jobs' manic dedication is the reason.

I still remember the [Apple \]\[][apple-2] machines that showed up in a
special, new lab in [Temple's][temple] computer science building, back in
1982, when I was an undergraduate. A few of us student consultants,
including Rob Keiser, Stan Spotts and me, were tapped to staff the lab.
Naturally, as geeks, we took the opportunity to play with the machines in
the lab. I spent way more time on the Apples than on the IBMs. Even then,
Jobs and Wozniak had a knack for making their computers seem more fun.

It's been amazing to watch where that humble machine, and garage-built
company, have gone.

Rest in peace, Steve Jobs.
