Impeaching George W. Bush





}}

The *Lexington Herald-Leader*, (a \`Knight-Ridder\`\_ newspaper),
ran
[an article][]
today claiming that a recent poll shows more Americans in favor of
impeaching George W. Bush.

That margin isn't huge. According to the article, a recent poll by
[Zogby International][] showed 52% of American
adults thought Congress should consider impeaching Bush if he
wiretapped U.S. citizens without court approval.

The article goes on to note that "impeachment" is increasingly
passing the lips of professional politicians, including Republican
[Arlen Specter][], senior Senator from
Pennsylvania.

Of course, it isn't going to happen, much as it might be deserved.
As long as the House is ruled by Republicans, impeachment is a
non-starter.

But, if Bush indeed broke the 1978 Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act, isn't that a lot closer to
[a high crime or misdemeanor][]
than lying about
