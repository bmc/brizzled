It was bad enough when [GoDaddy][] CEO Bob Parsons [killed an elephant][].
Many people decided to walk away from GoDaddy then, in protest. I did not
transfer my domains at that time, preferring to wait until they expired, to
conserve my cash flow. Plus, I will admit, I am not a fan of [PETA][]. I don't
like PETA's radical stance, and I have heard and read more than enough from
Ingrid Newkirk and Dan Mathews. PETA's response to Parsons' elephant hunt was
to organize a boycott of GoDaddy, and I dislike PETA enough that I have a knee-
jerk, irrational reaction against participating in _anything_ they sanction.

That said, however, Parsons' explanation of his elephant hunt smacks of spin.
His grand safari, and his politician-like response to the outcry, planted the
seed of discontent.

GoDaddy's most recent actions have caused that seed to sprout.

On December 21, 2011, [Gizmodo][] published the United States House of
Representatives Judiciary Committee's [list of supporters of H.R. 3251][], the
_Stop Online Piracy Act_ (SOPA).

GoDaddy is on that list. GoDaddy supports SOPA.

SOPA is a _very_ bad piece of legislation for the Internet. To understand precisely _how_ bad it is, read some of the following articles:

* [MythBuster Adam Savage: SOPA Could Destroy the Internet as We Know It][ref1] (*Popular Mechanics*)
* [All About SOPA, the Bill That Wants to Cripple Your Internet *Very Soon*][ref2] (*lifehacker*)
* [Stop the Internet Blacklist Legislation][ref3] (Electronic Frontier Foundation)
* [Google, Facebook, Zynga oppose new SOPA copyright bill][ref4] (CNet)
* [Please Take the No Go Daddy Pledge][ref5] (Lauren Weinstein)

GoDaddy's support for SOPA was the last straw for me. Today, I initiated the
transfer of all domains under my control (both personal and business), from
GoDaddy to another registrar. Like so many others on the Internet, I'm
[voting with my wallet][].

GoDaddy will no longer get any of my business.

**Update, December 23, 2011** GoDaddy has [reversed course][]. In a flurry
of disingenuous backpedaling, Warren Adelman, GoDaddy's CEO, said:

> Fighting online piracy is of the utmost importance, which is why Go Daddy has
> been working to help craft revisions to this legislationâ€”but we can clearly
> do better. It's very important that all Internet stakeholders work together
> on this. Getting it right is worth the wait. Go Daddy will support it when
> and if the Internet community supports it.

As Gizmodo's Casey Chan put it, "If a sleazeball company like GoDaddy can ditch
SOPA because of pressure from the Internet, you bet other companies currently
supporting SOPA will cave too. Let yourself be heard and let's freaking kill
this bill."

However, while I'm delighted that GoDaddy is responding to the pressure, I
don't trust that this reversal is anything more than panic and politics. I
doubt that they have _really_ realized the error of their ways. As
[Lauren Weinstein puts it](http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000922.html):

> Do not be fooled.  Make no mistake about their motives.  They're not suddenly
> against the censorship principles of SOPA: "Go Daddy will support it when and
> if the Internet community supports it."  There is no indication whatsoever
> that they have had a fundamental change of heart.

I'm still not giving that sleazeball company any more of my money. My domains
are on their way to another registrar.
