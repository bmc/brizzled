It was bad enough when [GoDaddy][] CEO Bob Parsons [killed an elephant][].
Many people decided to walk away from GoDaddy then, in protest. I did not
transfer my domains at that time, preferring to wait until they expired, to
conserve my cash flow. Plus, I will admit, I am not a fan of [PETA][]. I don't
like PETA's radical stance, and I have heard and read more than enough from
Ingrid Newkirk and Dan Mathews. PETA's response to Parsons' elephant hunt was
to organize a boycott of GoDaddy, and I dislike PETA enough that I have a knee-
jerk, irrational reaction against participating in _anything_ they sanction.

That said, however, Parsons' explanation of his elephant hunt smacks of spin.
His grand safari, and his politician-like response to the outcry, planted the
seed of discontent.

GoDaddy's most recent actions have caused that seed to sprout.

On December 21, 2011, [Gizmodo][] published the United States House of
Representatives Judiciary Committee's [list of supporters of H.R. 3251][], the
_Stop Online Piracy Act_ (SOPA).

GoDaddy is on that list. GoDaddy supports SOPA.

SOPA is a _very_ bad piece of legislation for the Internet. To understand precisely _how_ bad it is, read some of the following articles:

* [MythBuster Adam Savage: SOPA Could Destroy the Internet as We Know It][ref1] (*Popular Mechanics*)
* [All About SOPA, the Bill That Wants to Cripple Your Internet *Very Soon*][ref2] (*lifehacker*)
* [Stop the Internet Blacklist Legislation][ref3] (Electronic Frontier Foundation)
* [Google, Facebook, Zynga oppose new SOPA copyright bill][ref4] (CNet)
* [Please Take the No Go Daddy Pledge][ref5] (Lauren Weinstein)

GoDaddy's support for SOPA was the last straw for me. Today, I initiated the
transfer of all domains under my control (both personal and business), from
GoDaddy to another registrar. Like so many others on the Internet, I'm
[voting with my wallet][].

GoDaddy will no longer get any of my business.
