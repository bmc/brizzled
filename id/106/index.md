A month or so ago, [Nathan Hamblen][], of the
[New York Scala Enthusiasts][], sent an email to [Nermin Serifovic][] and
me, in our respective capacities as co-founders of the
[Boston Area Scala Enthusiasts][] and [Philly Area Scala Enthusiasts][]
users groups. Nathan mentioned that the [Scala Lift Off][] conference,
originally scheduled for late October, 2010, in New York, had been canceled.
Nathan thought our three Scala users groups might be able to put together
a small U.S. East Coast symposium, to fill the void.

Thus was born the first [Northeast Scala Symposium][].

Here was our original announcement:

> The Boston, Philadelphia, and New York Scala user groups have combined to
> organize the first ever Northeast Scala Symposium. This event will be
> held at the Meetup headquarters in New York, on February 18th, 2011.
>
> We've got lots of great speakers within our groups. At the Symposium,
> we'll get to share them among the groups and get to know Scala
> enthusiasts (and employers) across the region.
> And to pull in a bit of extra talent, we're offering $1,000 towards
> travel expenses for a headline speaker from anywhere. Applicants need
> only get in touch with one of the organizers with a short description of
> their talk. (See below for contact details.) Conference registrants will
> then vote for their favorite talk, and the winner will receive the full
> travel offset. We need to move quickly on this, so that people can make
> plans, so don't be shy about prodding your favorite person in the Scala
> world to pitch a talk.
> 
> Your registration fee of $50 covers the headline speaker's travel offset, and
> food and beverages for the event.

Several people pitched some neat-sounding talks. The RSVP'd attendees
voted, and [Daniel Spiewak][] narrowly beat out [Jonas Bon&eacute;r][jonas]
(of [Akka][] fame) for the featured slot. But, lucky for us, Jonas is
*still* going to come and give a talk.

So far, more than 50 people have ponied up their $50 and RSVP'd "yes,"
including some luminaries from the Scalaverse.

If New York and Scala sound like a fun way to break up a cold February,
there are still some slots left. Details are at <http://www.nescala.org/>.
