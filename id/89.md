Scala's [REPL][] is useful, but if
you're used to
[readline][],
you'll find it lacking and frustrating. Scala 2.8 is enhancing the
REPL, but in the meantime, here's a handy trick.

Scala's command-line interpreter (its
[REPL][]) is *highly* useful, but
if you're accustomed to
[readline][],
you'll find it lacking and frustrating. Scala 2.8 is enhancing the
REPL, but in the meantime, here's a handy trick.

Instead of typing

    $ scala

try this, instead:

    $ rlwrap scala -Xnojline

By disabling [JLine][] and invoking
Scala via `rlwrap`, you get full
[readline][]
capabilities in the Scala REPL.

On Windows, you can install the [Cygwin][]
version of `rlwrap`; it seems to work just fine in my tests.

Thanks to Tony Morris for

mailing list.
