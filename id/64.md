Why I have decided to disable comments on this blog.





}}

I've given in. I have a good anti-spam plug-in called
[Akismet][] installed here; it very capably
catches and segregates spam comments directed at this blog. But
they tend to accumulate, and I have to check them daily to make
sure there aren't any
[false positives][].
Lately, I've been getting well over 200 comment spams each day.
Shoveling those turds is becoming tedious. Since I don't tend to
receive a lot of comments anyway, I'm opting out. For now, anyway,
I'm simply bypassing these petty little skirmishes by disabling
comments completely.

If you're one of those rare individuals who actually wants to
comment on one of these blog posts, send me an email. You'll find
my email address under my photo. I'll post your email message to
the blog myself.
