I don't know why this crap continues to amaze me after more than a
decade, but it just does.

My spam filters have trapped more than 300 pieces of pork in the last day.
Meanwhile, the spam filtering software attached to this seldom-updated blog
has trapped another 300-400 pieces of blog comment spam. This latest flood
of [pr0n][]- and [turgidity][]-related verbiage began sometime last week.

I have no illusions that the spam problem will ever go away; luckily, I
have several lines of filter defenses which work surprisingly well: very
few false positives, very few missed pieces of spam ending up in my inbox,
no missed pieces of spam ending up in my blog. I do, however, have to clean
up those quarantined turds periodically, and the sheer size of that
[turd pile][] still amazes me sometimes.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Castration's too good
for those bastards.
