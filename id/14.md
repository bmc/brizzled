I am a generalist. (Here's what I mean by that.)





}}

I'm not the best at anything, and I probably never will be. And
that's very freeing.

That sounds like heresy, coming from an American. Let me explain.

There are people who must, at all costs, be the best at whatever
they do. If they're not going to be the best, they don't bother
trying.

We all do that, to some degree. I was never especially good at
sports. I tried various sports when I was a kid
([Little League][], soccer, track), but
I was an average player, at best. By the time I reached high
school, I was no longer participating in organized sports. I'd
gravitated toward activities where I could excel--music and
photography, for instance.

But that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about extreme
perfectionism, the notion that you have to be the absolute best at
something, or it's not worth it.

I'm not the best at *anything* I do. For instance, I enjoy
photography, calligraphy, and cartooning. I'm better than a lot of
people at all of those things--in some cases *way* better. But
there are thousands of photographers, calligraphers and
cartoonists, amateur and professional, who are better than I am.

The same holds true for my profession. I am a software developer by
vocation (and avocation), and I think I'm quite good at it. (Over
the years, my employers have tended to concur with that
assessment.) But I'm not the best. No matter how good I think I am
at writing software, I know that somewhere there is someone who is
better than I am.

You see, I am a generalist. There are a lot of things that interest
me. Even within the field of software, I'm not a specialist. I have
never focused exclusively on one area of software development. My
first job out of college (way back in 1983) was with the
[Philadelphia Stock Exchange][]. I worked with
the group that developed and maintained their online trading
system. But I didn't specialize in financial software. Since then,
I've worked on many different kinds of software (as evidenced by my
[resume][]). I worked on
[SNA][] emulators,
software engineering environments, ecommerce applications. I built
an [Internet firewall][] back
before commercial firewalls existed. I'm currently employed
developing and maintaining a large product that helps businesses
[manage product data][].

A successful generalist must come to terms with the fact that he
will probably never be *the* expert in any of the areas that
capture his interest. There will *always* be someone--often a
specialist, though not always--who knows more.

This realization may seem very depressing at first. Yet, earlier in
this essay, I wrote that it's freeing. It is.

Requiring yourself to be the absolute best at something sets the
bar very high. It also magnifies the consequences of failure. But,
worse than that, it can prevent you from even attempting something
new. I've seen this exact phenomenon in other people. Someone
decides not to try something new, intriguing, and exciting, because
he decides he cannot be the absolute best at it, thus denying
himself the enjoyment of pursuing something that might be
worthwhile anyway.

I may not be the absolute best at anything I do, but I try hard to
be damned good at the things I choose to attempt. I dig deeply, I
read (sometimes obsessively), I experiment, I try and fail and try
again (and frequently fail again). And, most important, I *enjoy*
myself. Since I don't require that I be *the* best, I can settle
for being very good, or just good, or even adequate, depending on
the endeavor.

Of course, there's a downside to this approach: The absolute best
are the ones we tend to remember. A man who dedicates himself to
being the absolute best surgeon, or scientist, or businessman may
well accomplish the sort of amazing things we'll remember for
generations.

But a generalist has certain advantages, too. A good generalist
often has a broader base of experience than a specialist. An
excellent generalist has a broad *and* deep base of experience.
Maybe his experience isn't as deep in any given area as a
specialist's experience in that same area, but there are advantages
to a broad base of experience. This idea was (and is) one of the
basic tenets of a traditional
[liberal arts education][].

Would I *like* to be the absolute best at something? Sure. Wouldn't
anyone? But I'm not willing to focus single-mindedly on that one
thing. It's the [rare person][] who can
be the absolute best at multiple things.

I've noticed, over the years, that a lot of people with the "I have
to be the *best*" mentality end up circumscribing themselves. They
don't try new things unless they feel they can be the absolute
best. Or they launch themselves into new activities, intending to
"beat" everyone else, only to abandon those same activities when
they find that they're never going to be the best.

Sometimes, it's better
[*not* to be the king][].
Sometimes, it's better to be a duke--to be recognized, while still
having the flexibility to engage in activities that the king cannot
pursue, because he's too busy trying to *stay* king.

I want to feel free to try many different things, to delve into new
endeavors, to dig deeply into something just because it interests
me.

No, I'm *not* celebrating mediocrity. I'm simply saying that
sometimes, for some people, "very good" is better than "best."
