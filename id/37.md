Bill Gates says spam will be "solved" in two years. Is he right?


}}

The *Seattle Post-Intelligencer* is carrying a story about Bill
Gates' 2-year-old prediction that "Two years from now, spam will be
solved."

Of course, the spam problem *isn't* solved. There's still lots of
it out there. Still, Gates' prediction can't be dismissed out of
hand. To quote from the article:

Whether you like Microsoft or you hate Microsoft, there *is*
something to that claim. I certainly see plenty of spam here;
anywhere from 40-60% of the email fielded by my SMTP server is
spam. But... how much of it actually lands in my inbox? Very
little, as it turns out.

I have [spam-blocking rules][] in my
Internet-facing SMTP server. And I use internal filtering
technology ([procmail][] +
[spamassassin][] +
[bogofilter][], in my case) that
is very effective at weeding out spam, without too many false
positives.

Sure, Microsoft's spinning the issue a bit, and they'd like you to
believe that *they're* largely responsible for licking the spam
problem&amp;\#8212;but they're not entirely wrong in asserting that
the spam problem is solved. A properly configured chain of filters
renders the spam problem less of a menace and more of, well, a very
minor annoyance.

Personally, these days I'm having far more problems with virus
storms than spam.

The spam revenue model isn't working that well any more. And that's
definitely a good thing, whether it's Microsoft's doing, or Yahoo's
doing, or because of the hard work of all those unsung regional
ISPs.
