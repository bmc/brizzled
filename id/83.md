For some time now, this blog and its immediate predecessor
[did not accept comments][]. I've decided to accept comments
via [Disqus][]. Disqus allows me to attach
comments to my blog without actually having to support them myself;
it provides moderation capabilities, authentication options, and a
variety of other useful features. Moreover, it's clearly becoming
quite popular.

So, I'm going to give it a try here.

For now, all comments are moderated, until I see how things go.
