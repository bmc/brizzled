I've decided to write a build tool in
[Scala][], because I really don't like
[Ant][].

**July, 2009, Update**: No, I haven't. I'm [using SBT][],
instead.

I've decided to write a build tool in
[Scala][].

# Because I don't like Ant

For awhile now, I have truly disliked
[Ant][], the standard build utility for Java.
Ant (and [Maven][]) use XML build files,
which means you're often standing on your head to get around
limitations imposed by the choice of XML as a syntax.

I dislike the whole trend of using XML as a configuration file
format. Yes, XML is human-readable. But it isn't always
human-*friendly*. I agree with
[Terence Parr][], author of
[ANTLR][] and
[StringTemplate][], who wrote, in 2001,
that XML is a poor human interface:

> XML should be a safe bet for most of your program-to-program data
> format needs. What about programs, specifications, initialization
> files, and the like that are conversations between a human and a
> computer? In this section, I hope to convince you that humans
> should not have to write and grok XML. Besides the many existing
> standard special-purpose languages that provide superior
> interfaces, XML is about as far away from natural human language as
> you can get.

See
"[Humans should not have to grok XML][]".

# And then there's *make*

Meanwhile, our old friend,
[make][]), uses a syntax
that is good and bad. What's good is that it's relatively easy to
see what depends on what. However, make's tab-sensitive syntax is
problematic, and it uses an external shell process as its
"programming" language, which imposes overhead and restricts
expressiveness.

Martin Fowler talks about many of these issues in his 2005 article
entitled
"[Using the Rake Build Language][]".

# A build file is ...

In my view, a build file serves two main purposes:

1.  It is a manifest, of sorts, for the components of the system
    being built.
2.  It must be able to contain custom logic for building, since
    there are often site-specific or project-specific tasks that must
    be performed.

As my friend and former colleague, Steve Sapovits, and I have often
argued in the past, build files are code. They are maintained like
code, they can be buggy like code, and they often require
"escaping" to code to do things.

So why not *make* them code?

# The Rake approach

That's what Rake did. A Rakefile is pure
[Ruby][], surrounded by an infrastructure
to manage dependencies, build certain common things, etc. But the
syntax of Rake is Ruby--simplified and customized by an internal
[DSL][] built
using native Ruby semantics. Thus, any editor or IDE that speaks
Ruby can handle a Rakefile. Better yet, if you have to do something
custom, something that the built-in Rake tasks cannot do, you have
the full power of Ruby at your disposal, right there in the
Rakefile.

Contrast that approach with Ant or *make*.

-   You can customize Ant, but you can only get the full power of a
    real programming language by writing an Ant task in Java (or
    another JVM language), compiling it, and making it available to
    Ant. You can't put little scriptlets of Java in an Ant file.

-   With *make*, you're pretty much stuck with either the shell,
    with all its limitations, or (in the case of
    [GNU Make][]), a macro syntax that
    becomes all but unmaintainable if you define complex macros (which
    I've done).


I much prefer the Rake approach.

# Python?

Since I do a lot of development in \`Python\` these days, I tried
building a Rake-like tool in Python. I know there are existing
Python build tools, such as [SCons][],
[Vellum][],
[zc.buildout][] and
[Paver][], but I wanted
something that used a simpler build file syntax, more akin to a
classic Makefile, while retaining the full power of Python.

It was a fun project, but Python presented some DSL limitations
that Ruby does not have. For instance:

-   In Python, you cannot capture an arbitrary block of code and
    save it for later. In Ruby (and Scala), you can. You can define a
    [lambda][] in
    Python, but lambdas have syntax limitations that make them
    unfriendly in this particular context. You can capture a function,
    but I wanted a simpler, more make-like syntax, instead of requiring
    people to define functions all over the place.
-   Python does not permit you to override operators. While this
    isn't a big deal at all in typical Python programming, it's awfully
    useful when defining a DSL.

As a result, the Python build tool (which I actually did implement,
but never released) uses a special external DSL that permits
embedded snippets of Python. (It uses David Beazley's excellent
[PLY][] Python lex and yacc
implementation to parse the file.)

But, of course, the resulting build file isn't actually Python,
even if it does contain Python, so none of my editor modes or IDEs
grok the syntax.

# Enter Scala

Meanwhile, I've been playing with Scala. Like Ruby, Scala has a
looser syntax (though, unlike Ruby, it's type safe). The relaxed
syntax, along with Scala's operator overloading, closures, and
other features, permit the definition of pretty powerful internal
DSLs. So I decided to try an experiment.

Using very little code, I was able to create a DSL that supports
this syntax:

    target("foo") -> ("foo.o", "lib.a")
    
        target("bar") -> ("bar.o", "lib.a") ===
        {
            // Scala logic goes here
        }

Further, by judicious use of an
[implicit conversion][],
I was able to remove the need for a `target()` function entirely,
so that the following syntax is equivalent to the above:

    "foo" -> ("foo.o", "lib.a")
    
        "bar" -> ("bar.o", "lib.a") ===
        {
            // Scala logic goes here
        }

The code I wrote does not include any of the supporting build
logic, because I haven't implemented that yet. But the syntax is
simple and easy to understand, while retaining the ability to use
Scala.

Just as a Rakefile is Ruby, this is perfectly legal Scala, provided
my small DSL classes are in scope. Thus, custom Scala build logic
can use any Scala or Java code that's in the CLASSPATH, and the
build file can define its own Scala classes and functions, as
necessary.

For my money, that's way better than Ant.

I've decided to build this tool. It's a small and well-defined
project that I can use to come up to speed on Scala. And, when it's
done, I intend to replace all my uses of Ant with this Scala-based
build tool. Maybe I'll even include an Ant adapter, enabling me to
make use of existing Ant tasks.

# Update: July 19, 2009

I've finally taken the time to play with both
[Gradle][] and
[SBT][]. (Thanks to
"grh" Daniel Spiewak for the pointers.) Both tools are easy to
configure and have built-in support for external dependency
management (i.e., what [Maven][] and
[Apache Ivy][] do).

Rather than spend time building yet another tool that does exactly
the same thing (only with a different syntax), I've elected to go
with [SBT][]. See my
[blog post][] on SBT.
