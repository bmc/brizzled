Stupid union tricks.





}}

Labor unions were born in violence and struggle, fighting to
survive and grow despite business's often brutal attempts to
suppress them. These early unions ended or reduced all kinds of
worker-unfriendly practices, from the exploitation of child labor
to unsafe working conditions. In many cases, it was the advent of
collective bargaining that resulted in workers actually
[earning a living wage in a safe environment][].

But, in recent years, organized labor has been having trouble.
Manufacturing and other big union stronghold industries have moved
out of the United States. Union scandals and corruption have gotten
significant news coverage. The public seems more ambivalent toward
and disenchanted with unions&amp;\#8212;forgetting, perhaps, the
days when businesses treated their workers almost as slaves. As
both
[George Will][]
and
[Robert Reich][]
noted recently, union membership stands at about 8% of the U.S.
workforce.

So, in this environment, you'd assume unions and union workers
would be more sensitive to their public images, more anxious not to
appear irrelevant, greedy, outdated, or downright ridiculous.

That may be true elsewhere, but it certainly isn't true in
Philadelphia.

Philadelphia has a history of strong unions, and they have been
portrayed (rightly or wrongly) as entrenched and intransigent. In
March, 2004, for instance, the
[Philadelphia Carpenters Union][]
caused enough trouble that the production team for
[MTV][]'s *Real World (Philadelphia)* halted
construction and threatened to move the series to another city.
This highly publicized incident did little to burnish the
reputation of Philadelphia's unions.

But that's nothing compared to what happened recently.

[Comcast][] is building a new headquarters
in Philadelphia, and they want the building to be environmentally
friendly. To that end, the developer, Liberty Property Trust, was
planning to install 116 waterless urinals in the building.

Then the Plumbers Union Local 690 stepped in. According to a
[March 19th article][]
in the
[*Philadelphia Inquirer*][]:

> The local plumbers union is blocking Liberty's plan to install
> no-flush, water-saving urinals in the men's rooms at the Comcast
> Center. Without them, the finished skyscraper would guzzle an extra
> 1.6 million gallons of water a year, and Liberty could have trouble
> obtaining a coveted seal of approval from the U.S. Green Building
> Council. ... Edward Keenan, the head of Local 690, which represents
> plumbers in Philadelphia and its suburbs, did not return phone
> calls for this story. But those involved in the urinal debate say
> the plumbers object to the waterless devices because they require
> less labor to install than the traditional kind.

Union officials' protestations to the contrary, this stance comes
off as obstructionist and anti-progress. Environmental groups had a
field day with the union.

Today, the *Inquirer* has
[a story][] that
describes a classic Philly compromise to the stalemate:

> A waterless-urinals agreement is in the can, and that means that
> the Comcast Center will be able to install the environmentally
> friendly basins in its new headquarters, a spokesman for Mayor
> Street announced last night.
> 
> Street brokered the complex deal between the developer, Liberty
> Property Trust, and Plumbers Union Local 690, with support from
> State Sen. Vincent J. Fumo after the potty standoff was made public
> in The Inquirer and became a cause celebre for the city's
> environmental groups.
> 
> The agreement clears the way for Liberty to install 116 no-flush
> urinals in the men's rooms at the 58-story Comcast Center, and
> increases the chances that the 975-foot skyscraper will earn the
> title of America's tallest green building.
> 
> Liberty, however, was forced to accept a long list of conditions to
> open the way for the green devices.
> **Most significantly, it agreed to install standard water lines with the urinals, although they are unnecessary and will not be connected.**
> The plumbers contend this is a backup measure, in case the urinals
> don't work.

(Emphasis mine.)

This compromise makes the Plumbers Union look silly. Waterless
fixtures (which do have drains, but don't require water supply
lines, because they don't flush) don't seem to fail any more often
than conventional fixtures, and they can
[save a substantial amount of money][].

This well-publicized story does nothing to enhance the reputation
of the Plumbers Union, or of unions in general. And that's a
[Bad Thing][], in
an age when unions are struggling to retain membership and
influence.

Way to go, guys.
