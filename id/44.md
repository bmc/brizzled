I'm intolerant of intolerance. Read on...

I was a freshman in college in 1979. The AIDS epidemic was just
becoming newsworthy at that time. According to at least
[one timeline][],
the disease wasn't called "AIDS" until 1982.

Of course, during the same period, the religious right--now a
potent part of the Republican Party's "base"--was also going
national. 1979 was the year that Jerry Falwell founded the Moral
Majority.

At first, in the United States, AIDS only seemed to afflict
homosexual men. This, of course, led to many a fiery denunciation
of homosexuals by self-righteous assholes from the religious right.
One day, during my sophomore year, as I hustled from one end of
campus to the other so I wouldn't be late for a class, I was
surprised to see a young, clean-cut man preaching, loudly, right in
the middle of campus, about how all these queers were going to hell
and how this new disease was God's punishment for their wickedness.
Mind you, this was an an [urban university][]
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, one with a highly diverse student
population. I remember thinking, "What an asshole," as I strode
past him.

Since then, homosexuality *seems* more acceptable. It's certainly
more apparent in the media. One of the most talked-about films this
Oscar season is
[Brokeback Mountain][], which
has been discussed to the point of nausea, actually. Gay characters
are more apparent on mainstream television shows, too (even if
they're often effectively neutered, so they won't offend middle
America).

Yet we still have hateful, intolerant jerks running around,
claiming that (for instance)
[God hates fags][]. Self-righteous
attention-seekers like
[Pat Robertson][]
use their television shows to warn cities that gay pride parades
are likely to bring God's wrath down upon them.

What *is* it with these extreme right-wing Christian nutbags,
anyway? They claim to model their lives after Jesus--a man so
tolerant that he scandalized the religious right of *his* time by
spending time with prostitutes, tax collectors and all manner of
people the "righteous" labeled as scum. Back in August,
[Andrew Lang][] hit the nail on the
head when he
[wrote, about Pat Robertson][]:

> Pat Robertson's god is the military messiah of Armageddon theology.
> Like some other evangelicals (not all, thank God) Robertson reads
> the Bible as a fantasy novel about revenge. His Jesus is the
> muscular action hero of pop culture: a Punisher, Terminator or
> Darkman who exterminates his enemies with brutal efficiency.

For more than four years now, we've been painfully aware of the
dangers of Islamic religious extremism. But are people like
[Fred Phelps][] (the man
behind [godhatesfags.com][]), or Pat
Robertson, or other prominent hate-mongering Christian extremists
all that different?

I have a very young daughter. One of these days, she's going to ask
me, in all innocence, what makes some people such hateful
hypocrites.

I honestly have no idea how to answer that one.
