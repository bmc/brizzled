Yet another odd (okay, stupid) reaction to the avian flu threat.


}}

nHere's another example of how we, as a culture, seem utterly
incapable of assessing [risk][] in
a meaningful, rational manner.

These are excerpts from a
[New York Times][]
article on the preparations the U.S. poultry industry is taking to
stave off financial ruin when the
[H5N1][] avian
[influenza][] virus hits the U.S.

The same 46% probably aren't aware that unless they're actually
buying live birds from a market or living next to a chicken coop,
they're highly unlikely to catch the virus from a bird. They're far
more likely to get sick from
[salmonella][],
[listeria][]
or
[campylobacter][]
viruses. In 2005, the USDA estimated that
[more than 16% of all chickens sold in the U.S. were infected with the *salmonella* virus.][].

But the good news is that you can kill *all* these viruses by
cooking chicken properly and following some basic
[safety practices][].

Of course, there's this little twist, too: The inhumane conditions
under which most of our poultry is raised may actually help
*protect* the meat supply from avian flu:

Well, isn't *that* special?

Chain them to the wall! Don't let 'em out! Their comfort is nothing
compared to our right to be free of the negligible risk of getting
H5N1 from eating their dead, cooked flesh!

(Disclaimer: I like chicken. I don't plan to stop eating it.)

And then there's this dubious spin:

> The Egg Safety Center said that consumers should not worry about

> acceptable for sale.

Uh, right. *That's* convincing.

The Egg Safety Center would've sounded more credible, and less like
the industry shill that they are, if they'd simply pointed out that
when you cook your eggs properly, you kill the virus--and you
*want* cook them properly anyway, because there's already an
*existing* risk of *salmonella*, never mind avian flu.

People panic over unrealistic scenarios like getting avian flu from
eating chicken, but they still fail to wash their hands often
enough (or thoroughly enough), they don't exercise
[appropriate precautions][]
against catching *any* strain of influenza, they drive too fast on
highways while talking on cell phones, and they generally engage in
all manner of behavior that pose far more risks to their ongoing
survival than the minuscule chance that they could catch avian flu
from eating chicken.

If avian flu becomes a problem, it won't be from eating chicken.
It'll be from human-to-human contact, when the virus mutates so
that it can
[spread from person to person.][]

I wish people could learn to evaluate risks properly, but I fear we
are, on the whole,
[innumerate][] beyond
redemption.
