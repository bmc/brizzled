WAPs, WEP, WPA, Windows, Linux, MacOS X--and now my head hurts.





}}

We bought my wife a new laptop. I finally got it configured today,
but I was having trouble getting Windows to connect to our wireless
access points for some reason. I was still using
[WEP][]. So, as a quick test, I
switched the closest WAP to use
[WPA][],
made the appropriate change in Windows, and the laptop immediately
connected. Okay, cool. Problem solved, finally. We go with WPA.
It's a bit more secure, anyway.

Of course, this immediately led to more work.

One of the four WAPs here (yes, four WAPs--it's funny what an
[old farm house][] will do to high-frequency radio
signals) is a router, one of those wireless routers that thinks
it's connecting to the Internet out one interface. I'd faked it out
so I could use it as an internal WAP. I had it set up so its WAN
(Internet) interface plugged into my LAN. Meanwhile, its LAN
interface (on a separate segment) plugged into a hub that the other
WAPs plugged into. With this thing in place, I actually had two
LANS: the "regular" one and the "wireless" one. This is fine in
theory (and is potentially more secure), but in practice, it turns
out to be a pain in the ass. Besides, the router was being cranky
about WPA. So, I decided to get rid of it. The other WAPs are
[Linksys WAP54G][]'s,
and I like them, so I ordered another WAP54G from
[NewEgg.com][]. Then, I disconnected one of
the existing WAP54Gs (the one that's used the least), moved it into
my office, and swapped it for the wireless router. The NewEgg one
will replace the one I swiped.

Yay! Now everything's on the same LAN again. And things are
simpler, right?

Not so fast...

Of course, this new arrangement complicated *my* laptop's
connectivity, since Linux (and BSD, for that matter) systems use
this less-than-trivial \`wpa\_supplicant\`\_ user-space program for
WPA negotiation. And I'm running
[Fedora Core 4][] on my laptop. WEP was
handled directly by the wireless driver, but WPA negotiation is
handled by this front-end program that brings up the interface
*after* WPA negotiation is complete--but it doesn't automatically
fire up the
[DHCP client program][]
to get an IP address. You have to jump through some hoops to get
that done. (I ended up using
[ifplugd][].)
Straightening *that* out actually took me a couple hours, even
though I'd already solved a similar problem to gain access to the
WPA-secured environment at corporate headquarters. But, of course,
I've upgraded software since my last visit to corporate HQ...

With all the configs, the scripts, and the jerry-rigging, getting
WPA working on my Linux box makes me feel like
[Rube Goldberg][].
(Break one link in the chain, and the gun fires, awakening the
monkey, who shits on a plate, which sags under the extra weight,
flipping the switch to "off"--and, boom! no more network
connection.)

But, finally, I was done, right?

Oh, crap. I'd forgotten about [TiVo][].

We have TiVo. (I don't have the time, and I suspect my wife doesn't
have the patience, for me to make
[my own DVR][] right now...) TiVo downloads
its program information over the Internet, using a wireless USB
NIC.

Okay, simple enough to reconfigure, right?

Wrong. TiVo doesn't do WPA, only WEP. That's probably because they
didn't feel like dealing with the Rube Goldberg `wpa_supplicant`
shit, either.

Dammit. *Now* what? I don't have a *wired* USB
[NIC][]. And,
there's no RJ-45 on the back of the TiVo box, because TiVo
[requires a USB NIC][].
And there's no CAT-5 jack near the TiVo anyway; I'd have to run
cable from the hub in the basement, drill a hole in the floor, and
poke it up into the living room. As if I wanted to be doing *that*
at 10:30 PM, when I still had work waiting for me in the office.

"There *has* to be a less obnoxious solution to this mess," I
muttered to myself.

"Oh!" (more muttering) "I know! I'll take the decommissioned
wireless router down into the basement, hook it up to the hub I
already have down there, then define a separate
[SSID][]
and different authentication criteria for it."

Another hour, five trips to the basement, and some scrounging for a
power strip later, I finally managed to get TiVo back on the
network.

As [Bill the Cat][] might
say, "Ack! Thbbbt!"

My home network is small, but it's officially way more complicated
than the networks of some companies I've worked for. I keep a
*diagram*, for chrissakes. I've already told my wife, if I get hit
by a truck or something, email the diagram to a couple of geeky
friends.

Every time I go through an exercise like this, I think, "What the
hell would my dad do?" I'm a software developer, and I have done my
share of system administration; I understand this crap, and it's
*still* damned fragile at times. What about all those non-technical
consumers who buy wireless gear and expect to be able to plug it in
and have it Just Work? Sure, for many people, it's as simple as
plugging in a wireless router and firing up the laptop. But as soon
as you get into
[MAC address][] filtering,
encryption, disabling SSID broadcasts, and all that Good, Healthy,
Secure Stuff, the average Joe would be lost.

No wonder half (at least!) of the neighborhood wireless access
points are completely unsecured.

No wonder non-geeks hate computers.
