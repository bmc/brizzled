Barack Obama's voice sounds like ...





}}

So, I was listening to the radio last night
([NPR][], if you must know), and they aired a
brief clip of [Barack Obama][]. Once
again, I found something oddly
[familiar][] about his voice.
Then, it hit me: He sounds like
[Frank][]
[Zappa][].

That may be reason enough to vote for him.
