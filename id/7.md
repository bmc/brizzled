I bought a Wacom Graphire 4, and it's fantastic!





}}

One of my Christmas gifts this year was a
[Wacom Graphire-4 4x5 drawing tablet][].

What an amazing device!

Of course, I'm not using it under Windows (and I don't own a Mac).
But, with the help of the software and the copious documentation
provided by the
[Linux Wacom Project][], I was
able to get it working under
[Fedora Core Linux][] with minimal
difficulty.

The coolest thing is how well [The GIMP][] is
[integrated with such a tablet][].
In the GIMP, each pointing device has its own separate context. The
GIMP remembers the last tool, color palette, etc., assigned to each
device; when I take my hand off the mouse and switch to the Wacom
stylus, the GIMP automatically switches back to the settings that
were in effect when I last used the stylus. The "regular" mouse,
the Wacom stylus and the stylus' eraser tip are all separate
pointers, so each can have its own separate settings. This turns
out to be *really* useful. I can, for instance, associate the
stylus with the GIMP's "ink pen" tool and the eraser with the
GIMP's "eraser" tool. Then, after drawing for a bit, I can simply
flip the pen end-for-end to erase something--exactly the way a real
pencil works. It's all very natural. And the integration with The
GIMP's "ink pen" tool is nothing short of phenomenal.

I wanted this tool primarily to make
[digital photo retouching][]
easier. A stylus allows for much finer motor control than a mouse.
However, I've been an amateur calligrapher and cartoonist for more
than 30 years, and I find that, properly configured, the stylus and
tablet allows me to do some fairly decent calligraphy and
cartooning right on the computer. It's not quite the same as
working with a real pen on real paper, but it's a lot closer than I
would've expected. In fact, I drew the caricature of myself that
adorns this blog entirely within The GIMP, with the aid of the
Wacom stylus.

As with most such finds, I wonder why I didn't start using one of
these things sooner.
