Mark Chadwick writes a cool and simple broadcast-UDP notification
framework, and we find interesting uses for it at the office.


}}

A short time ago, colleague and friend,
[Mark Chadwick][], put together an
interesting little Python tool he calls
[eventter][].
Basically, it's a small API around a simple
[UDP][]
broadcast messaging protocol. An eventter sending process emits a
message, and all eventter listeners on the local network receive
it.

If that were it, eventter wouldn't be all that interesting.
However, Mark wrote an example receiver that forwards any message
it receives to [DBUS][]. Run that
receiver on a Linux machine under Gnome, and any message sent via
the eventter framework shows up as a small, temporary Gnome
notification.

I added two more sample receivers, one for
[Growl][] (for Mac OS X machines) and one for
[Snarl][] (for Windows machines).
So the
[eventter][]
distribution has adapters for Growl-like services on three major
platforms.

"But what's the point?" you ask. Well, we've actually found some
interesting uses for eventter at the office. For instance:

-   Mark installed an eventter command client as a
    [subversion][] post-commit hook. Now,
    whenever anyone commits anything to our source code repository,
    everyone running an eventter receiver sees the commit message for a
    few seconds.
-   I added a similar command line client to our
    [CruiseControl][]
    continuous build server. Now, whenever a build completes, the name,
    version and status of the build (success or failure) are emitted
    via eventter.

I also modified my local copy of the Growl and DBUS receivers so
they log received messages to a file. That way, I can quickly
review what's happened over the last hour or so, just by looking at
that log file.

The UDP broadcast messages even propagate over our
[VPN][], so someone working from home can still
see them.

I've become rather fond of this tool. It's simple, clean,
well-written, easy to adapt, and surprisingly useful.
