# Introduction

As noted previously, I recently [rehosted this blog][] on
Google's [App Engine][] (GAE). Writing
a small, but functional, blog engine is a useful exercise in
learning a web framework. I wrote blog software to learn more about
[Django][], and I ported it to App
Engine to learn more about App Engine.

In this article, I recreate the steps necessary to build a blogging
engine that runs under GAE.

# Acknowledgments

I'm grateful to the following people for reviewing and commenting
on this article before I published it.

-   [J.J. Geewax][]
-   [Toby DiPasquale][]
-   [Mark Chadwick][]
-   [Rob Keiser][]

In addition, the following people sent me some valuable insights
and corrections after the article was published:

-   [Bill Katz][], for clarifying the
    querying of list properties.
-   [Fernando Correia][], for
    reminding me that unique keys do have associated unique IDs,
    forcing me to re-read that part of the GAE docs again.
-   [Alexander Kojevnikov][], for clarifying that
    the GAE user API works with Google accounts, not GMail accounts.
    (The difference is that a registered Google user need not be a
    GMail user.) Alexander also pointed out that `Query.fetch(1)` can
    be more simply expressed as `Query.get()`.
-   [Mark Lissaman][], for pointing out
    a semantic error in the `picoblog` code.

# Caveats

Before I jump into the tutorial, there are a few caveats:

-   The point of this article is to build an App Engine
    application, to get to know some GAE internals. If you just want to
    host a blog on GAE, and you're not interested in understanding the
    software involved, you might consider installing
    [cpedialog][], a blogging engine
    that will run on GAE.

-   I am *certain* there are things about GAE that I could do
    better. I welcome corrections and suggestions; just drop me an
    email.


## What this Blog Engine Supports

The blog engine outlined in this article is fully functional; this
blog runs on similar software. However, it lacks a few features
some people might want, such as:

-   Image uploading. I just haven't put that in yet. When I do,
    I'll update this article. In the meantime, I'm able to live without
    it by uploading the images via GAE's `appcfg.py update` capability.
-   Comments. It's easy enough to drop
    [Disqus][] into your templates, if you want.
-   Integration into blog aggregators like
    [Technorati][]. (There's a follow-up
    article on this topic.)

It *does* have the following features, though:

-   Tag handling, including support for generating a tag cloud.
-   Support for RSS and Atom feeds.
-   Displaying articles by month or tag.
-   Template-driven theme customization.
-   Unpublished drafts.
-   Secured administration screens.
-   [reStructuredText][]
    markup (instead of HTML) for the articles.

In short, it's a serviceable blog engine, with simple,
straightforward code you can customize as you see fit.

# The Code

The source code for this blog engine is available on GitHub. See
the Picoblog web page, at
[http://bmc.github.com/picoblog/][]

# Get Going with App Engine

## Register and Download

First, of course, you have to register with
[GAE][] and download the development
kit. This article assumes you've already done that.

## Create your Application

Next, from your GAE account, create a new application. You'll have
to create a unique identifier for the application. In this article,
I use the application ID "picoblog". You'll want to use something
else.

This article is not a tutorial on how to use the App Engine tools
and web site; it's an article about building a blog application.
So, I'm not to go into details about how to create your application
on the [GAE][] site. Google's wizard is
easy enough to follow.

## Open the App Engine Docs

You'll want to have the online
[App Engine documentation][]
available as you develop your App Engine application. It wouldn't
hurt to review the *Getting Starting* section before jumping in.

## Create your Local Application Directory

Create a directory called `picoblog` in which to do your work. In
that directory, create a file called `app.yaml`:

    application: picoblog
    version: 1
    runtime: python
    api_version: 1
    
    handlers:
    - url: /static
      static_dir: static
    
    - url: /favicon.ico
      static_files: static/favicon.ico
      upload: static/favicon.ico
    
    - url: /admin
      script: admin.py
      login: admin
    
    - url: /admin/.*
      script: admin.py
      login: admin
    
    - url: /.*
      script: blog.py

This file configures your application. You can treat most of the
top of the file as magic. For now, the parts we care about are:

:`application`: The application's registered ID is "picoblog".

:`handlers`: Each `url` entry is a regular expression GAE will match
  ~ against incoming URL requests; on a match, it'll run the
    associated script. In this case, we're saying:

    -   Any path starting with `/static` is resolved via the built-in
        static file handler. This is where we'll put our images. So go
        ahead and create a `static` directory under `picoblog`.

    -   Since browsers always look for `/favicon.ico`, and I get tired
        of seeing all the "not found" messages in the logs, there's an
        entry for an icon. It's stored in the `static` directory.

    -   The administrative screens (for creating and editing blog
        articles) live under '/admin' and are secured: Only a Google
        account with administrative privileges on the project is allowed to
        get to them. They're handled by the `admin.py` script. We'll be
        creating that script in the `picoblog` directory.

    -   Finally, the published blog itself matches everything else, and
        it's handled by the `blog.py` script. That script, too, will end up
        in the `picoblog` directory.



Once you've created `app.yaml`, you can pretty much forget about it
for awhile.

# Create the Data Model

The next step is to decide what data we're storing in the database.
For this blog engine, there's a single object type in the database,
called an `Article`. It has the following properties (which would
be columns in a SQL database):

-   `title`: The 1-line title of the article
-   `body`: The body of the article, which is reStructuredText
    markup.
-   `draft`: Whether or not the article is a draft (i.e., not published)
      ~ or not. Drafts are only visible in the administration screen.


-   `published_when`: The time the entry was published. In this
    context, "published" means "goes from being a draft to not being a
    draft". This time stamp is initialized to the time the article is
    created, and it's updated when the article is saved as a non-draft.
    (Toggling the "draft" flag multiple times will continue to update
    this time; you're obviously free to change that behavior by hacking
    the code.)
-   `tags`: a list of tags (strings) assigned to the articles. May
    be empty.
-   `id`: a unique ID assigned to the article.

A note about the unique ID: GAE does not provide support for an
automatically incremented integer ID field the same way that Django
does. An item in the datastore *does* have a unique key, accessible
via the `key()` method. Further, that key can be converted to a
corresponding unique name or number (depending on how the key was
assigned) by calling `key().id()`. For instance:

    article = Article(title='Test title')
    article.put()
    print article.key().id()

However, you cannot use this ID in a query. Quoting from the
[Keys and Entity Groups][]
section of the GAE documentation:

> Key names and IDs cannot be used like property values in queries.
> However, you can use a named key, then store the name as a
> property. You could do something similar with numeric IDs by
> storing the object to assign the ID, getting the ID value using
> obj.key().id(), setting the property with the ID, then storing the
> object again.

So, that's what we're going to do.

The data model for our `Article` class looks like this:

    import datetime
    import sys
    
    from google.appengine.ext import db
    
    class Article(db.Model):
    
        title = db.StringProperty(required=True)
        body = db.TextProperty()
        published_when = db.DateTimeProperty(auto_now_add=True)
        tags = db.ListProperty(db.Category)
        id = db.StringProperty()
        draft = db.BooleanProperty(required=True, default=False)

If you're familiar with Django, you'll notice that it's similar to
Django's data models, but not exactly the same.

Next, since I like to hide as much of the database API semantics
inside the model, I'm going to add a `get_all()` method that
returns all articles, a `get()` method that returns a single
article by ID, and a `published()` method that returns all
non-draft articles. (The `published()` method will be separated
into two methods, so the query itself can be shared. More on that
later.)

    @classmethod
    def get_all(cls):
        q = db.Query(Article)
        q.order('-published_when')
        return q.fetch(FETCH_THEM_ALL)
    
    @classmethod
    def get(cls, id):
        q = db.Query(Article)
        q.filter('id = ', id)
        return q.get()
    
    @classmethod
    def published_query(cls):
        q = db.Query(Article)
        q.filter('draft = ', False)
        return q
    
    @classmethod
    def published(cls):
        return Article.published_query()\
                      .order('-published_when')\
                      .fetch(FETCH_THEM_ALL)

`FETCH_THEM_ALL` is an integer constant with a large value, defined
at the top of the module.

**NOTE**: In the original version of the code, and in the zip files
posted to the [web site][],
`FETCH_THEM_ALL` is defined as follows:

    FETCH_THEM_ALL = sys.maxint - 1

On a 64-bit local machine, `sys.maxint` will evaluate to a 64-bit
number. But GAE is a 32-bit environment, so the code may fail on
certain machines. The code in the
[GitHub repository][] has been
corrected.

For a more complete understanding of the GAE query interface, see
the
[documentation for the Query class][]
and the
[GAE Query Filter][]
documentation.

Finally, let's add a `save()` method that does two important
things:

-   Copies the GAE-assigned unique ID into our `id` field, so we
    can use it in queries.
-   Updates the time stamp if the article being saved is going from
    draft to published status.

    def save(self):
        previous_version = Article.get(self.id)
        try:
            draft = previous_version.draft
        except AttributeError:
            draft = False
    
        if draft and (not self.draft):
            # Going from draft to published. Update the timestamp.
            self.published_when = datetime.datetime.now()
    
        try:
            obj_id = self.key().id()
            resave = False
        except db.NotSavedError:
            # No key, hence no ID yet. This one hasn't been saved.
            # We'll save it once without the ID field; this first
            # save will cause GAE to assign it a key. Then, we can
            # extract the ID, put it in our ID field, and resave
            # the object.
            resave = True
    
        self.put()
        if resave:
            self.id = self.key().id()
            self.put()

Okay, that's the model. (See the \`source code\`\_ for the complete
file.)

# Create the Administration Screens

Now let's create the administration screens, so we can edit and
create articles. We'll create two screens.

The main administration screen contains three things:

-   A button to create a new article. Pressing this button creates
    an empty article and launches the Edit Article screen to edit it.
-   A button to go back to blog itself.
-   A list of the existing articles. The articles will be sorted in
    reverse chronological order, and each article's date and title will
    be displayed. The article's date and title will also be a hyperlink
    to the edit screen for the article. Further, drafts will be shown
    in red, to distinguish them from published articles.

The Edit Article screen contains

-   A text box for the the title
-   A text area for the body of the article, which is assumed to be
    reStructuredText
-   A text box for the list of tags (comma-separated)
-   A check box to indicate whether or not the item is a draft

To create these screens requires five files:

-   `defs.py` will hold some constants that we share between all
    the blog scripts.
-   `request.py` will hold a base class request handler, which is
    basically a place to hang logic that we need in every script.
-   `admin.py` contains the Python code for the admin screens--the
    equivalent of a Django `views.py` file for the admin screns.
-   `admin-main.html` is the template for the main administration
    screen.
-   `admin-edit.html` is the template for the Edit Article screen.

To keep things organized, we'll store the templates in a
`templates` subdirectory.

## The Templates

Let's start with the templates.

GAE's default template engine is Django's template engine. If you
don't know Django's template language, read the first few sections
of the
[Django template language][]
document. Describing Django templates is beyond the scope of this
article.

### Main Administration Screen Template

You can see the
[full template for the main administration screen here][].

It consists of a link to the style sheet, some Javascript, some
standard HTML layout, and this block of template logic:

    &lt;ul&gt;
    {% for article in articles %}
      {% if article.draft %}
      &lt;li class="admin-draft"&gt;
      {% else %}
      &lt;li class="admin-published"&gt;
      {% endif %}
      {{ article.published_when|date:"j F, Y" }}&amp;nbsp;
      &lt;a href="/admin/article/edit/?id={{ article.id }}"&gt;{{ article.title }}&lt;/a&gt;
    {% endfor %}
    &lt;/ul&gt;

This template code assumes that the variables passed to the
template will include a Python list called `articles`, each element
of which is an `Article` object. We'll see how that's populated in
the next section.

The style sheet link looks like this:

    &lt;link href="/static/style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/&gt;

Rather than use a template `{% include "style.css" %}` directive to
pull the style sheet file inline at rendering time, we're telling
the browser to go get it. We'll be using the same style sheet for
all pages; using an external style sheet allows the browser to
cache it.

### The Style Sheet

To see the style sheet, [follow this link][].
The style sheet is stored in the `static` subdirectory, where it'll
be served by the GAE static file handler.

### The Edit Screen Template

The
[template for the edit screen is available here][].
The edit screen is slightly more complicated, since it has some
Javascript to handle the various buttons. But overall, it's still
pretty simple as web screens go.

## The View Code

The view code for the administration screens is in `admin.py`. It,
too, is relatively simple. But first, let's look at the two other
files we're using to consolidate common logic.

### `defs.py`

`defs.py` just contains some common constants:

    BLOG_NAME = 'PicoBlog'
    BLOG_OWNER = 'Joe Example'
    
    TEMPLATE_SUBDIR = 'templates'
    
    TAG_URL_PATH = 'tag'
    DATE_URL_PATH = 'date'
    ARTICLE_URL_PATH = 'id'
    MEDIA_URL_PATH = 'static'
    ATOM_URL_PATH = 'atom'
    RSS2_URL_PATH = 'rss2'
    ARCHIVE_URL_PATH = 'archive'
    
    MAX_ARTICLES_PER_PAGE = 5
    TOTAL_RECENT = 10

We'll see how they're used as we get further into this tutorial.

### `request.py`

`request.py` contains our base request handler class:

    import os
    
    from google.appengine.ext import webapp
    from google.appengine.ext.webapp import template
    
    import defs
    
    class BlogRequestHandler(webapp.RequestHandler):
        """
        Base class for all request handlers in this application. This class
        serves primarily to isolate common logic.
        """
    
        def get_template(self, template_name):
            """
            Return the full path of the template.
    
            :Parameters:
                template_name : str
                    Simple name of the template
    
            :rtype: str
            :return: the full path to the template. Does *not* ensure that the
                     template exists.
            """
            return os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),
                                defs.TEMPLATE_SUBDIR,
                                template_name)
    
        def render_template(self, template_name, template_vars):
            """
            Render a template and write the output to ``self.response.out``.
    
            :Parameters:
                template_name : str
                    Simple name of the template
    
                template_vars : dict
                    Dictionary of variables to make available to the template.
                    Can be empty.
            """
            template_path = self.get_template(template_name)
            template.render(template_path, template_vars)

As you can see, it just contains some methods to make rendering
templates a little simpler.

### `admin.py`

*Now* we're ready to look at the administration view code. First,
we have some imports:

    import cgi
    
    from google.appengine.api import users
    from google.appengine.ext import webapp
    from google.appengine.ext.webapp import util
    
    from models import *
    import request

These are followed by the request handler classes:

    class ShowArticlesHandler(request.BlogRequestHandler):
        def get(self):
            articles = Article.get_all()
            template_vars = {'articles' : articles}
            self.response.out.write(self.render_template('admin-main.html', 
                                                         template_vars))
    
    class NewArticleHandler(request.BlogRequestHandler):
        def get(self):
            article = Article(title='New article',
                              body='Content goes here',
                              draft=True)
            template_vars = {'article' : article}
            self.response.out.write(self.render_template('admin-edit.html',
                                                         template_vars))
    
    class SaveArticleHandler(request.BlogRequestHandler):
        def post(self):
            title = cgi.escape(self.request.get('title'))
            body = cgi.escape(self.request.get('content'))
            id = int(cgi.escape(self.request.get('id')))
            tags = cgi.escape(self.request.get('tags'))
            published_when = cgi.escape(self.request.get('published_when'))
            draft = cgi.escape(self.request.get('draft'))
            if tags:
                tags = [t.strip() for t in tags.split(',')]
            else:
                tags = []
            tags = Article.convert_string_tags(tags)
    
            if not draft:
                draft = False
            else:
                draft = (draft.lower() == 'on')
    
            article = Article.get(id)
            if article:
                # It's an edit of an existing item.
                article.title = title
                article.body = body
                article.tags = tags
    
                article.draft = draft
            else:
                # It's new.
                article = Article(title=title,
                                  body=body,
                                  tags=tags,
                                  id=id,
                                  draft=draft)
    
            article.save()
    
            edit_again = cgi.escape(self.request.get('edit_again'))
            edit_again = edit_again and (edit_again.lower() == 'true')
    
            if edit_again:
                self.redirect('/admin/article/edit/?id=%s' % id)
            else:
                self.redirect('/admin/')
    
    class EditArticleHandler(request.BlogRequestHandler):
        def get(self):
            id = int(self.request.get('id'))
            article = Article.get(id)
            if not article:
                raise ValueError, 'Article with ID %d does not exist.' % id
    
            article.tag_string = ', '.join(article.tags)
            template_vars = {'article'  : article}
            self.response.out.write(self.render_template('admin-edit.html',
                                    template_vars))
    
    class DeleteArticleHandler(request.BlogRequestHandler):
        def get(self):
            id = int(self.request.get('id'))
            article = Article.get(id)
            if article:
                article.delete()
    
            self.redirect('/admin/')

The file ends with some initialization logic and the main program:

    application = webapp.WSGIApplication(
        [('/admin/?', ShowArticlesHandler),
         ('/admin/article/new/?', NewArticleHandler),
         ('/admin/article/delete/?', DeleteArticleHandler),
         ('/admin/article/save/?', SaveArticleHandler),
         ('/admin/article/edit/?', EditArticleHandler),
         ],
    
        debug=True)
    
    def main():
        util.run_wsgi_app(application)
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()

Let's break this down a bit. First, the initialization logic at the
bottom (that is, the creation of the `webapp.WSGIApplication`
object) defines what classes (*handlers*) will handle which URLs
within the `/admin/` URL space. Recall that the
[app.yaml][] file points all `/admin` URLs to this file.
The `application` variable further breaks those URLs down, so that
certain URLs map to certain handlers. The list passed to the
`WSGIApplication` constructor contains tuples; each tuple defines a
URL mapping.

-   The first element of the tuple is a regular expression. Note
    that the regular expressions we're using end with `/?`, allowing
    the trailing slash to be omitted in the URL.
-   The name of the class that will handle requests to URLs that
    match the regular expression.

Next, let's look at some of the handlers. There are basically two
kinds of handlers here:

-   Handlers that just display a page (i.e., retrieve data from the
    database and stuff it into a template).
-   Handlers that process form submissions.

#### Handlers that Only Display a Page

`ShowArticlesHandler`, `NewArticlesHandler` and
`EditArticlesHandler` are example of handlers that simply display a
page. Here's the `ShowArticlesHandler` class again:

    class ShowArticlesHandler(request.BlogRequestHandler):
        def get(self):
            articles = Article.get_all()
            template_vars = {'articles' : articles}
            self.render_template('admin-main.html', template_vars)

First, because it defines only the `get()` method, it supports just
the HTTP GET semantics. (POST is not supported for the associated
URL.)

The actual handler is simple: It retrieves all articles, whether
draft or published, puts the resulting list in a dictionary, and
uses that dictionary to render the template. That's it; that's the
*entire* handler. The `NewArticleHandler` is similarly simple.

The `EditArticleHandler` is a little more complicated, only because
it has to handle a few additional things:

    class EditArticleHandler(request.BlogRequestHandler):
        def get(self):
            id = int(self.request.get('id'))
            article = Article.get(id)
            if not article:
                raise ValueError, 'Article with ID %d does not exist.' % id
    
            article.tag_string = ', '.join(article.tags)
            template_vars = {'article'  : article}
            self.render_template('admin-edit.html', template_vars)

First, it determines whether the article being edited is in the
database or not; if not, it throws an exception, because it should
never be invoked on a non-existent article. (If it is, we have a
bug.)

Next, it creates a comma-separated string from the list of tags, so
the template can simply stuff that string into the tags edit box.

#### Handlers that Process Forms

The most complicated handler is the `SaveArticleHandler` class.
Let's look at that one again:

    class SaveArticleHandler(request.BlogRequestHandler):
        def post(self):
            title = cgi.escape(self.request.get('title'))
            body = cgi.escape(self.request.get('content'))
            id = int(cgi.escape(self.request.get('id')))
            tags = cgi.escape(self.request.get('tags'))
            timestamp = cgi.escape(self.request.get('timestamp'))
            draft = cgi.escape(self.request.get('draft'))
            if tags:
                tags = [t.strip() for t in tags.split(',')]
            else:
                tags = []
            tags = Article.convert_string_tags(tags)
    
            if not draft:
                draft = False
            else:
                draft = (draft.lower() == 'on')
    
            article = Article.get(id)
            if article:
                # It's an edit of an existing item.
                article.title = title
                article.body = body
                article.tags = tags
                article.draft = draft
            else:
                # It's new.
                article = Article(title=title,
                                  body=body,
                                  tags=tags,
                                  id=id,
                                  draft=draft)
    
            article.save()
    
            edit_again = cgi.escape(self.request.get('edit_again'))
            edit_again = edit_again and (edit_again.lower() == 'true')
            if edit_again:
                self.redirect('/admin/article/edit/?id=%s' % id)
            else:
                self.redirect('/admin/')

That one's a little longer, but what it does is simple enough:

-   First, it retrieves all the form variables.
-   Next, if there are any tags in the form, it splits the tag
    string to make it into a list.
-   The tags are actually stored as GAE `db.Category` objects, not
    strings, so the code calls a special `Article` class method to
    convert the strings from the form into `Category` objects. (Consult
    the code for that conversion method; it's trivial, and it's not
    included here.)
-   It processes the Draft checkbox.
-   It attempts to load the referenced article. If the article
    exists, the handler updates its contents. Otherwise, it creates a
    new Article object with the specified ID.
-   Then, it saves the article.
-   If the `edit_again` request variable is set, then the handler
    redisplays the edit screen; otherwise, it displays the main
    administration screen again.

That's it. We've finished our admin screens. Let's take a look at
them. To do that, fire up a terminal window, change your working
directory to the `picoblog` directory, and run the following
command. (You must have put the root of the unpacked GAE toolkit in
your path.)

    dev_appserver.py .

You'll see output something like this:

    INFO     2008-08-06 02:51:26,336 appcfg.py] Server: appengine.google.com
    INFO     2008-08-06 02:51:26,342 appcfg.py] Checking for updates to the SDK.
    INFO     2008-08-06 02:51:26,444 appcfg.py] The SDK is up to date.
    INFO     2008-08-06 02:51:26,534 dev_appserver_main.py] Running application
    pico on port 8080: http://localhost:8080

You can now surf to `http://localhost:8080/admin/` using your
browser.

Here's a screen shot of the main screen, showing several articles.
The top-most article is a draft; the rest are published.

![image][]
The
[full-size main page image is here][].

And here's the edit screen for the draft article:

![image][]
The
[full-size edit page image is here][].

From a stylistic viewpoint, these screens are really simple.
However, making them look fancier and slicker is simply a matter of
fiddling with the templates and the stylesheet. The Python code
doesn't change.

# The Markup Language

Rather than force the blogger (i.e., you or me) to enter HTML, I've
chosen to use the
[reStructuredText][] (RST)
markup language. Of course, this means the blog has to translate
the RST text into HTML when someone wants to view the blog. We can
either do that conversion when we save the article, or convert on
the fly when someone visits the blog.

Converting the markup when we save the article is more efficient,
but it means we have to store the generated HTML and reconvert all
previously saved articles whenever we change the templates or the
style sheet. It's simpler to convert on the fly. If this strategy
ends up causing a performance problem, we can always go back later
and add page caching.

## Docutils

To support RST, the first thing we have to do is make the
[Docutils][] package available to
our running code. The easiest way to do that is to visit the
[Docutils][] web site, download the
source code, unpack it, and move the `docutils` subdirectory (and
all its contents) into our blog directory. When we later upload the
application to GAE, the Docutils code will get uploaded, too.

Docutils also looks for a `roman.py` file, which isn't present in
the GAE Python environment. There's one in the Google App Engine
source directory (which you downloaded); copy the `roman.py` file
from there into the top directory of the blog.

## Translation code

The code that actually translates RST to HTML is rather simple:

    import os
    
    from docutils.core import publish_parts
    
    def rst2html(s):
        settings = {'config' : None}
    
        # Necessary, because otherwise docutils attempts to read a config file
        # via the codecs module, which doesn't work with AppEngine.
        os.environ['DOCUTILSCONFIG'] = ""
        parts = publish_parts(source=s,
                              writer_name='html4css1',
                              settings_overrides=settings)
        return parts['fragment']

The only wrinkle is the setting of the `DOCUTILSCONFIG` environment
variable. I determined empirically that if you don't set that
variable to an empty string, the Docutils package attempts to read
a startup file via the `codecs` module, and the way it calls the
`codecs.open()` method conflicts with how that method is defined in
the GAE Python library. (GAE has replaced Python's file handling
routines with routines of its own, and they're not always 100%
compatible.)

Store this code in file `rst.py`. We'll then import it in our
display code.

# Create the Display Screens

Now we're ready to create the display screens. There are six views
to support:

-   **Main** shows the top *n* articles (where *n* is the value of
    `MAX_ARTICLES_PER_PAGE` in the `defs.py` file). This screen is the
    main blog screen--the one a visitor sees first.
-   **Show One Article** shows a single article. It's used when
    someone clicks

    on the link for a single article.
-   **Show Articles by Tag** shows all articles with a specific
    tag.
-   **Show Articles by Month** shows all articles in a specified
    month.
-   **Show Archive** lists the titles and dates of all articles in
    the blog.
-   **Not Found** is a simple screen to display when an article or
    page isn't found.


We'll also add some query methods to the `Article` class as we go
along.

## Base Template

The simplest way to build these screens is to use Django template
inheritance, which has the additional benefit of ensuring a
consistent look. Most of the HTML goes into a
[base template][]. That template defines the
basic look and feel of the display pages, with various template
substitutions like `{{ blog_name}}` and `{{ blog_owner}}`.

However, the base template also contains template code like the
following:

    &lt;div id="articles_container"&gt;
      {% block main %}{% endblock %}
    &lt;/div&gt;

and this:

    &lt;div id="right-margin"&gt;
      {% block recent_list %}{% endblock %}
      {% block date_list %}{% endblock %}
    &lt;/div&gt;

The blocks can be filled in by other templates that inherit from
this one.

## `blog.py`

The handlers go in `blog.py`, which is similar to `admin.py`.
There's an initialization section at the bottom that sets up the
URL-to-handler mappings. Let look at that first:

    application = webapp.WSGIApplication(
        [('/', FrontPageHandler),
         ('/tag/([^/]+)/*$', ArticlesByTagHandler),
         ('/date/(\d\d\d\d)-(\d\d)/?$', ArticlesForMonthHandler),
         ('/id/(\d+)/?$', SingleArticleHandler),
         ('/archive/?$', ArchivePageHandler),
         ('/rss2/?$', RSSFeedHandler),
         ('/atom/?$', AtomFeedHandler),
         ('/.*$', NotFoundPageHandler),
         ],
    
        debug=True)

## `AbstractPageHandler`

At the top of the file, there's a base class that consolidates a
lot of the common logic. The most important method it contains is
`render_articles()`:

    class AbstractPageHandler(request.BlogRequestHandler):
    
        def render_articles(self,
                            articles,
                            request,
                            recent,
                            template_name='show-articles.html'):
            url_prefix = 'http://' + request.environ['SERVER_NAME']
            port = request.environ['SERVER_PORT']
            if port:
                url_prefix += ':%s' % port
    
            self.augment_articles(articles, url_prefix)
            self.augment_articles(recent, url_prefix)
    
            last_updated = datetime.datetime.now()
            if articles:
                last_updated = articles[0].published_when
    
            self.adjust_timestamps(articles)
            last_updated = self.adjust_timestamp(last_updated)
    
            blog_url = url_prefix
            tag_path = '/' + defs.TAG_URL_PATH
            tag_url = url_prefix + tag_path
            date_path = '/' + defs.DATE_URL_PATH
            date_url = url_prefix + date_path
            media_path = '/' + defs.MEDIA_URL_PATH
            media_url = url_prefix + media_path
    
            template_variables = {'blog_name'    : defs.BLOG_NAME,
                                  'blog_owner'   : defs.BLOG_OWNER,
                                  'articles'     : articles,
                                  'tag_list'     : self.get_tag_counts(),
                                  'date_list'    : self.get_month_counts(),
                                  'version'      : '0.3',
                                  'last_updated' : last_updated,
                                  'blog_path'    : '/',
                                  'blog_url'     : blog_url,
                                  'archive_path' : '/' + defs.ARCHIVE_URL_PATH,
                                  'tag_path'     : tag_path,
                                  'tag_url'      : tag_url,
                                  'date_path'    : date_path,
                                  'date_url'     : date_url,
                                  'atom_path'    : '/' + defs.ATOM_URL_PATH,
                                  'rss2_path'    : '/' + defs.RSS2_URL_PATH,
                                  'media_path'   : media_path,
                                  'media_url'    : media_url,
                                  'recent'       : recent}
    
            return self.render_template(template_name, template_variables)

This method takes:

-   a list of `Article` objects to be displayed
-   the original incoming HTTP request
-   a list of recent articles to display (which can be empty)
-   the template name to use, which defaults to the
    `show-articles.html` template

`render_articles()` then puts together the list of template
variables, renders the specified template, and returns the result.

All the display handlers will use this method, which is why it
resides in the base class.

Another method we should examine is `augment_articles()`, also in
the `AbstractPageHandler` class:

    def augment_articles(self, articles, url_prefix, html=True):
        for article in articles:
            if html:
                try:
                    article.html = rst2html(article.body)
                except AttributeError:
                    article.html = ''
            article.path = '/' + defs.ARTICLE_URL_PATH + '/%s' % article.id
            article.url = url_prefix + article.path

This method renders the HTML for each article to be displayed (if
requested), and computes the article's path and URL.

The base class also contains a few other methods used by
`render_template()`:

-   `get_tag_counts()` assembles the list of unique tags,
    associating an article count with each one. It also determines
    which CSS class to associate with each tag, based on the tag's
    relative frequency, for use when rendering the tag cloud; this
    information is returned in a list of `TagCount` objects.
    (`TagCount` is defined in `blog.py`. It's not shown here.)
-   `get_month_counts()` returns a list of `DateCount` objects that
    the number of articles in each unique month/year.
-   `get_recent()` gets the most recent articles, making sure the
    list doesn't exceed the maximum specified in `defs.TOTAL_RECENT`.

(See the complete file in the \`source code\`\_ for details.)

## Not Found Page

Next, let's get the *Not Found* page out of the way. The template
is very simple:

    {% extends "base.html" %}
    
    {% block main %}
      &lt;p class="article_title"&gt;Not Found&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Sorry, but there's no such page here.&lt;/p&gt;
    {% endblock %}

It extends the base template and fills in the `main` block with a
simple static message. We'll use this template in a couple places.

The `NotFoundHandler` class is also simple:

    class NotFoundPageHandler(AbstractPageHandler):
        def get(self):
            self.response.out.write(self.render_articles([],
                                                         self.request,
                                                         [],
                                                         'not-found.html'))

Recall that this handler is the last, catch-all handler in the list
of URLs in `blog.py`, so it's automatically invoked if the incoming
request doesn't match any of the preceding URLs.

That's all we have to do to install a custom "not found" handler.

## Main Page

The main screen requires a template and a handler. With the base
template and the `AbstractPageHandler` class in place, both are
pretty simple. Here's the template, which resides in
`show-articles.html`:

    {% extends "base.html" %}
    
    {% block main %}
      {% for article in articles %}
        {% include "article.html" %}
        &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
      {% endfor %}
    {% endblock %}
    
    {% block recent_list %}
      {% if recent %}
        &lt;b&gt;Recent:&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        {% for article in recent %}
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="{{ article.path }}"&gt;{{ article.title }}&lt;/a&gt;
        {% endfor %}
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      {% endif %}
    {% endblock %}
    
    {% block date_list %}
      {% if date_list %}
        &lt;b&gt;By month:&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        {% for date_count in date_list %}
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="{{ date_path }}/{{ date_count.date|date:"Y-m" }}/"&gt;
              {{ date_count.date|date:"F, Y" }}&lt;/a&gt; ({{ date_count.count }})
        {% endfor %}
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      {% endif %}
    {% endblock %}
    
    {% block tag_list %}
      {% if tag_list %}
        &lt;div id="tag-cloud"&gt;
        {% for tag_count in tag_list %}
          &lt;a class="{{ tag_count.css_class }}"
             href="{{ tag_path }}/{{ tag_count.tag }}/"&gt;
             {{ tag_count.tag }}({{ tag_count.count }})&lt;/a&gt;
             {% if not forloop.last %},{% endif %}
        {% endfor %}
        &lt;/div&gt;
      {% endif %}
    {% endblock %}

The template extends the base template, and then just fills in the
HTML for each block that's defined in the base template. Note, in
particular, this block:

    {% for article in articles %}
      {% include "article.html" %}
    {% endfor %}

The actual template that displays an article resides in yet another
file, so it can be re-used in different templates.
`show-articles.html` includes it, repeatedly, in a loop that
traverses the list of articles to be displayed.

The `article.html` template looks like this:

    &lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"&gt;
      &lt;tr class="article_title_line"&gt;
        &lt;td class="article_title"&gt;{{ article.title }}&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="timestamp"&gt;
           {{ article.published_when|date:"j F, Y \a\t g:i A" }}
        &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        {% if article.draft %}
        &lt;td colspan="2" class="article-body-draft"&gt;
        {% else %}
        &lt;td colspan="2" class="article-body"&gt;
        {% endif %}
        {{ article.html }}
        &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td colspan="2" class="article-footer"&gt;
          &lt;a href="{{ article.path }}" class="reference"&gt;Permalink&lt;/a&gt;|
          Tags: {{ article.tags|join:", " }}&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

It's relatively easy to understand: It assumes the existence of a
variable called `article` that contains the article to be
displayed.

The handler for the main page is even simpler:

    class FrontPageHandler(AbstractPageHandler):
        def get(self):
            articles = Article.published()
            if len(articles) &gt; defs.MAX_ARTICLES_PER_PAGE:
                articles = articles[:defs.MAX_ARTICLES_PER_PAGE]
    
            self.response.out.write(self.render_articles(articles,
                                                         self.request,
                                                         self.get_recent()))

It gets the list of published articles, trims it down to the
maximum number of articles on the main page, renders the articles
to HTML, and dumps the result to the App Engine HTTP response
object.

If you did not leave the `dev_appserver` running, bring it up
again. Then, connect to `http://localhost:8080/`, and check out
your main page. It should look something like this:

## Show One Article

This screen shows a single article. It's invoked when a reader
selects a single post (e.g., `http://www.example.org/blog/id/5`).

It re-uses the same `show-articles.html` template, but with just
one article in the list. The handler looks like this:

    class SingleArticleHandler(AbstractPageHandler):
    
        def get(self, id):
            article = Article.get(int(id))
            if article:
                template = 'show-articles.html'
                articles = [article]
                more = None
            else:
                template = 'not-found.html'
                articles = []
    
            self.response.out.write(self.render_articles(articles=articles,
                                                         request=self.request,
                                                         recent=self.get_recent(),
                                                         template_name=template))

It attempts to retrieve the article with the specified ID. If the
article exists in the database, then the code puts it in a
single-element list and tells `render_articles()` to use the
`show_articles.html` to display it.

If the article does not exist, the code uses the `not-found.html`
template we defined earlier to display the generic "not found"
screen.

Note that this version of the `get()` method accepts an `id`
parameter. Where does that come from? Recall the configuration for
this handler in the `WSGIApplication` object at the bottom of the
script:

    application = webapp.WSGIApplication(
        [ ...
    
         ('/id/(\d+)/?$', SingleArticleHandler),
    
         ...
         ],

Note that the regular expression, `'/id/(\d+)/?$` contains a group,
`(\d+)`. Like Django, GAE maps each group into a parameter to the
`get()` or `post()` method. In this case, the string that matches
the regular expression group (the article's numeric ID, in this
case) is passed as the first parameter to the `get()` method.

## Show Articles By Tag

The `ArticlesByTagHandler` class again re-uses the
`show-articles.html` template:

    class ArticlesByTagHandler(AbstractPageHandler):
        def get(self, tag):
            articles = Article.all_for_tag(tag)
            self.response.out.write(self.render_articles(articles,
                                                         self.request,
                                                         self.get_recent()))

Note, however, that it's calling a class method called
`all_for_tag()` in the `Article` class. We have to extend `Article`
to support this query method. That method turns out to be trivial:

    @classmethod
    def all_for_tag(cls, tag):
        return Article.published_query()\
                      .filter('tags = ', tag)\
                      .order('-published_when')\
                      .fetch(FETCH_THEM_ALL)

My original version of this method loaded all published articles
and manually searched through their tags. However, in an
[email to the Google App Engine mailing list, Bill Katz][]
pointed me to
[something I missed in the GAE docs][]:

> In a query, comparing a list property to a value performs the test
> against the list members: `list_property = value` tests if the
> value appears anywhere in the list.

This is convenient and more efficient than my original solution.

## Show Articles By Month

By now, you should be getting the hang of this.

Next, we have to write a handler that'll produce a page of posts
for a given month. As with the tag handler, the month handler is
trivial:

    class ArticlesForMonthHandler(AbstractPageHandler):
        def get(self, year, month):
            articles = Article.all_for_month(int(year), int(month))
            self.response.out.write(self.render_articles(articles,
                                                         self.request,
                                                         self.get_recent()))

Again, though, it calls an `Article` class method we have yet to
write:

    @classmethod
    def all_for_month(cls, year, month):
        start_date = datetime.date(year, month, 1)
        if start_date.month == 12:
            next_year = start_date.year + 1
            next_month = 1
        else:
            next_year = start_date.year
            next_month = start_date.month + 1
    
        end_date = datetime.date(next_year, next_month, 1)
        query = Article.published_query()\
                       .filter('published_when &gt;=', start_date)\
                       .filter('published_when &lt;', end_date)\
                       .order('-published_when')
        return query.fetch(FETCH_THEM_ALL)

This method chains query filters to the query returned by
`Article.published_query()`. The filters ensure that the returned
articles are the ones published within the specified year and
month.

## Show Archive

This page shows the titles of all published articles, in reverse
chronological order. I chose to make this page even simpler than
the other pages: It lacks the tag cloud, recent posts, and
posts-by-month sections in the margin. The template is trivial:

    {% extends "base.html" %}
    
    {% block main %}
      &lt;span class="heading"&gt;Complete Archive:&lt;/span&gt;
      {% if articles %}
        &lt;ul&gt;
        {% for article in articles %}
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="{{ article.path }}"&gt;{{ article.title }}&lt;/a&gt;
              ({{ article.timestamp|date:"j F, Y" }})
        {% endfor %}
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      {% else %}
      &lt;p&gt;This blog is empty. (Someone want to fix that?)
      {% endif %}
    {% endblock %}

And the handler is, once again, trivial:

    class ArchivePageHandler(AbstractPageHandler):
        def get(self):
            articles = Article.published()
            self.response.out.write(self.render_articles(articles,
                                                         self.request,
                                                         [],
                                                         'archive.html'))

Note that `ArchivePageHandler` passes an empty list for the
"recent" posts (since it won't be used) and the archive template.

Here's what the archive page looks like with our two articles in
the archive:

![image][]
The [full archive page image is here][].

## RSS Feed

Any decent blog supplies an RSS feed, so we should do that, too. Of
course, that's simply a matter of writing a template and a small
handler. By now, the handler should look pretty familiar:

    class RSSFeedHandler(AbstractPageHandler):
        def get(self):
            articles = Article.published()
            self.response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'text/xml'
            self.response.out.write(self.render_articles(articles,
                                                         self.request,
                                                         [],
                                                         'rss2.xml'))

The template is simple, too:

    &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
    &lt;rss version="2.0" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"&gt;
      &lt;channel&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;{{ blog_name }}&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link&gt;{{ blog_url }}&lt;/link&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;{{ blog_name }}&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;pubDate&gt;{{ last_updated|date:"D, d M Y H:i:s T" }}&lt;/pubDate&gt;
        {% for article in articles %}
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;title&gt;{{ article.title }}&lt;/title&gt;
          &lt;link&gt;{{ article.url }}&lt;/link&gt;
          &lt;guid&gt;{{ article.url }}&lt;/guid&gt;
          &lt;pubDate&gt;{{ article.timestamp|date:"D, d M Y H:i:s T" }}&lt;/pubDate&gt;
          &lt;description&gt;
            {{ article.html|escape }}
          &lt;/description&gt;
          &lt;author&gt;{{ blog_author }}&lt;/author&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        {% endfor %}
      &lt;/channel&gt;
    &lt;/rss&gt;

# Deploy the Application

Test the application using `dev_appserver`; when you think it's
ready, it's time to deploy it. From within the blog's top-level
source directory, run this command:

    appcfg.py update .

That'll upload your application to your Google App Engine account.
If the application name is `picoblog`, then your live application
will appear at `http://picoblog.appspot.com/`.

# Handling Static Files such as Images

Of course, a blog should be able to display images. Since our new
blog software doesn't support image upload, how can we use images?
The answer is simple, if slightly clunky: Put any images you want
to use in your `picoblog/static` directory. Then, use `appcfg.py`
to update the live application; `appcfg.py` will copy those images
up to the Google App Engine server, where you can use them.

For instance, assume you have a picture call `foo.png` that you
want to use in a blog article. Here's how you might deploy it:

    $ cd picoblog
    $ cp ~/foo.png static
    $ appcfg.py update .

Then, you can use the reStructuredText `.. image` directive to pull
it into an article:

    .. image:: /static/foo.pn
       :width: 180
       :height: 150

# Previewing a Draft

There's one last feature to add: The ability to preview a draft
article without publishing it.

With this software in place, you can already do that by using a
separate browser window or frame. For instance, suppose you're
editing a new article, and its ID happens to be 53. In another
window, you can surf to that ID directly, using the URL
`http://picoblog.appspot.com/id/53/`.

But it might also be nice to preview the article in the same window
where you're doing your editing. That turns out to be trivial to
implement: Merely go back to \`The Edit Screen Template\`\_, and
add these lines right after the end of the form:

    &lt;h1 class="admin-page-title"&gt;Preview:&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;div style="border-top: 1px solid black"&gt;
    &lt;iframe src="/id/{{ article.id }}" width="97%" scrolling="auto" height="750"
            frameborder="0"&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;

Now, you'll always have a preview frame underneath the edit
controls.

# Enhancements

Now that you have the basic blog in place, you can start to add
other enhancements, such as:

-   Support for [Pygments][] syntax coloring.
-   Support for
    [Google Analytics][], which is
    useful for analyzing logs and traffic.
-   Image uploading.
-   A more individual theme.
-   etc.

# In Closing

In this (long) tutorial, we built a simple blog using Python and
Google's App Engine. The code represented in this article is very
similar to the code that runs this very blog; it's certainly
effective, even if it lacks certain bells and whistles right now.
With any luck, you now have a better understanding of what it means
to build an application on App Engine.
