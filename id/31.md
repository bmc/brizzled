The photofloods arrive.


}}

My \`Smith-Victor\`\_
[photoflood kit][]
arrived a couple days ago. I could've gone with the more
"professional" (and way more expensive) halogens, but I opted for
old-style photoflood lamps. The kit was cheaper; the replacement
bulbs are cheaper; and I'm shooting digital, not film, so I don't
have to worry about the
[color balance of the film][]
(as long as I'm careful about
[adjusting the white balance][]
on my
[digital SLR][]).
I *do* have to worry about color temperature changes as the bulbs
age, though. According to the little bit of research I've done so
far, halgens last longer and don't change color temperature as they
age, whereas photofloods don't last as long and tend to change
temperature as they age. Photofloods also consume more energy--but
it's not like I'm going to be leaving them on for long periods of
time. Bottom line for me: Photofloods make sense, until and unless
I've reached a level of studio proficiency that demands something
significantly better. I don't expect that to happen for awhile.

The kit has three lights with stands: two 10-inch reflectors and
one 5-inch reflector. It comes with three 250 watt (6500 lumens)
bulbs, color temperature 3200K. This is cooler (bluer) than the
average 100 watt incandescent bulb (which runs about 2865 Kelvin),
but warmer than sunlight. (Summer noontime sunlight is about 5400
Kelvin in my part of the world.) 3200K is standard for a
photoflood.

The
[white umbrella][]
accessory is still on order.

I'm going to have to do a lot more reading to bone up on artificial
lighting, especially as it applies to digital photography.
Fortunately, there are some
[good resources][]
on the web and in the local bookstore.

First "studio" job: This year's Christmas portrait of my daughter.

I suspect my next photography-related purchase may be an
[incident light meter][]...
