What's wrong with this picture? If the bike were *really* a pipe
bomb, what kind of idiot bomber would actually advertise it by
affixing a prominent sticker stating, "This bike is a pipe bomb"?

We're turning into a bunch of fearful old ladies, and, in our fear,
we're
[allowing the government to legislate away our civil liberties][]
and allowing the executive branch
[to run roughshod over the Constitution][].

What is happening to this country, anyway?
