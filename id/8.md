A programming war story involving deadlocks and semaphores.





}}

At [work][] a couple of days ago, we had a
lively discussion about deadlocks and deadlock avoidance, as it
relates to our product. The discussion somehow reminded me of my
first job, and similar problems we sometimes encountered there.

After graduating from [Temple University][]
in 1983, with a degree in computer science, I took a job with the
[Philadelphia Stock Exchange][], working in the
small group that built and maintained its
[online trading system.][]
The system was written in an extended and robust dialect of the
[Pascal programming language][],
and it ran on Honeywell DPS-6/90 minicomputers.

This system used two locking mechanisms to protect access to
[critical regions][] of
code. The first locking mechanism was an explicit system lock (a
system
[semaphore][])),
and the second was a priority switch. We had three classes of
processes. Each class ran at a different priority; within a class,
all processes ran at the same priority. If you had to lock a
resource (e.g., a queue) that could be used across process classes,
you had to use the more expensive system semaphore. If you simply
wanted to lock a region of memory that was shared by processes
*within* a class, you made a significantly cheaper system call that
temporarily raised the process's priority, ensuring that none of
its brethren could preempt it until it finished; at the end of the
critical region, you'd make another call to reset the process's
priority.

Obviously, attempting to put something on a queue (thus using a
semaphore) within a "raised priority" region was a strict no-no,
because it could result in a deadlock. Naturally, there were
occasional bugs, usually in code written in haste under deadline
pressure, where that happened. Having a real-time stock trading
system grind to a halt because of a hard-to-reproduce deadlock (or,
for that matter, because of *any* bug) was no fun. As we sat in the
computer room at the console, desperately trying to diagnose the
problem (not always easy to do), Stock Exchange VPs would start to
trickle in. A row of executives with crossed arms and tapping feet
is not conducive to solving a deadlock problem.
