I'm currently teaching myself
[C\#][]. As a
long-time [Java][] programmer, I am finding
that C\# now beats the pants off Java, the language. This is a
little depressing, frankly, but not all that surprising.

I'm currently teaching myself
[C\#][] (with
[.NET][] to follow); my client is
building a new data warehouse, and the support tools will be
Windows-based. As a newly minted consultant, it also can't hurt to
have .NET/C\# experience under my belt, even if I generally prefer
to do my development anywhere but Windows. As a consultant, I need
to maximize the possibility of getting future contracts; if that
means doing Windows, I'll do Windows (and program where I'd
*prefer* to program at home).

As pretty much anyone who knows me knows, I am not a huge fan of
[Microsoft][]. I've spent a large part of
my career programming on Unix-like systems. From 1999 to 2008, I
worked for an
[independent software vendor][],
as a core member of their development team; the product was written
almost entirely in [Java][].

I like the Java VM. It's mature, it's fast, it's highly portable,
and there are loads of languages running on it. When I was
developing full-time in Java, I was the only member of the team
whose desktop ran Linux; everyone else used Windows. With Java, it
didn't matter. In fact, it was an advantage. Several of our clients
ran our software on Unix-like systems; having at least one
developer who used and tested our product on Linux was a win. Our
nightly build system was a cheap Linux server, as well; since Java
runs anywhere there's a Java VM, anyone on our team (as well as any
of our customers) could run executables produced on that Linux
box.

But Java, the language, depresses me lately. It's being left in the
dust by other languages. [Scala][], my
current favorite language on the Java VM, incorporates many newer
(and some not so new) ideas that have yet to find their way into
Java.

Worse, though, for Java enthusiasts: Java has fallen behind C\#.
I'm boning up on C\# using O'Reilly's *C\# in a Nutshell* book.
(See
\`[http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596001810/][]\`\_.
As an aside, the "Nutshell" books are an excellent way to learn a
new language, if you already know *n* other languages.) I'm only
partway through the book, but it's already clear to me that,
overall, C\# (the language) now has more goodness in it than Java
does. I have to give Microsoft credit (much as it may pain me to do
so). Here are some things C\# now has that Java does not:

-   Lambdas, which are way better than anonymous inner classes.
    (C\# has anonymous inner classes, too.)

-   Delegates. You can kind of do this in Java, but it's not as
    clean.

-   Operator overloading. This feature can be abused all to hell,
    but it is still occasionally useful, especially in libraries and in
    [DSLs][].

-   Properties. No need to write getters and setters. Everything
    looks like a direct field access, even if it isn't. This is
    Python's idiom, and Scala's, too, and once you start using it, you
    never want to expose explicit getters and setters, ever again.
    `foo.x += 1` is *so* much more readable than
    `foo.setX(foo.getX() + 1)`.

-   A `yield` coroutine capability. Though I prefer Python's syntax
    (and Scala's) to C\#'s, this is a powerful and highly useful
    capability. If you've ever used it to build lazy iterators (in
    Python, Scala, C\#, whatever), you know what I mean.

-   Extension methods. These are the C\# equivalent of the Scala
    [implicit type conversion][]
    feature, and they're damned useful. They permit you to "extend"
    existing classes, even if they're final, without actually extending
    them. Like the Scala version, there's a mechanism for bringing the
    implicit conversions in scope; they don't happen automatically.
    (Think of them as a kind of scope-controlled
    [monkeypatching][].)
    [**Note**: As Tony Morris points out, in the comments to this
    article, extension methods are not *really* the equivalent of
    Scala's implicit type conversions; Scala's implicits are much more
    powerful. Still, it's clear that C\# has borrowed one useful aspect
    of this notion, and it's equally clear that Java does not have a
    feature that's even remotely close to either Scala's implicits or
    C\#'s extension methods.]

-   A
    [null coalescing operator][]
    that provides a simple syntax for dereferencing a reference and
    supplying a default if the reference is null.


In addition, C\# has many of the same features as Java, including:

-   interfaces
-   generics
-   autoboxing and auto-unboxing
-   annotations (though C\# calls them "attributes")

I *still* prefer the JVM to
[CLR][].
The JVM is robust, mature, fast, and (above all) portable. But
Java, the language, has fallen behind, and it now lacks a lot of
the useful features C\# has. One of the reasons I'm all over
[Scala][] these days is that it corrects
those flaws in Java, providing many up-to-date features while still
permitting me to use the power and convenience of the JVM. Either
via libraries or built-ins, Scala provides the same features as
C\#, with a few more thrown in for good measure. (I also happen to
think Scala is a better language than C\#, but I'll save that
tangent for another time.) But, in the .NET world, C\#, not Scala,
is the *lingua franca*. And C\#, and .NET, are the biggest
hearts-and-minds competitor Java has.

Sun and the Java community have allowed Java, the language, to
stagnate to the point where, compared to C\# and Scala, it is
almost painful to use. As a long-time Java programmer, I have to
say, that makes me a little sad.
